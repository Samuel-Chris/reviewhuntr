It is not just a want. They desire phenomenal quality. As I have noticed in my own experiences, this holds true regardless of the type of person. The audiophile may be a working professional or a student who happens to love music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that no one could attend a live concert with exceptional sound quality every single day, the objective of a consistently astounding listening experience seems impossible to achieve. But as demonstrated by high-end headphones, it isn’t that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the kind of music you like, a great pair of headphones could be the difference between drearily hearing a distorted song and thoroughly enjoying a crystal clear performance. By simply upgrading your listening equipment,  find new life in old songs. You may also discover fresh notes that you previously missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not unveil the best parts of new music right from the get-go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIFIMAN HE1000 V2 Headphones with Planar Magnetic Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; promises to check all of these boxes, and then some. They are pricey, alright. But the significant part about these headphones is that they undoubtedly fulfill their claims of delivering excellent sound quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boasting the use of the world’s first-nanometer diaphragm, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIFIMAN HE1000 V2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also features an advanced asymmetrical magnetic circuit, a patented structure for natural soundstage, and manual craftsmanship for high-quality design. When combined, these features come together to offer sound quality that is natural and distortion-free. For those upgrading from lower-range headphones, it promises to turn their listening experience around for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nanometer diaphragm in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIFIMAN HE1000 V2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is supposed to deliver faster response while keeping distortion at bay. As noted by those who have used these headphones, the thin diaphragm does its job impressively. The sound produced by these headphones delivers crisp, bright, and vibrant tunes at every session. No matter the genre of music, the headphones’ sound quality remains notably natural and reminiscent of a great live listening experience. This notion means that if you are one to enjoy music without the restriction of the genre, these headphones would be a perfect match for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advanced asymmetrical magnetic circuit, which uses a double-sided design, works together with the nanometer diaphragm to elevate the distortion-free listening experience even further. The feature also translates into real-world use effectively and provides users with a midrange that is free of any reflections or deflections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted by users, this is once again evident in the sound quality produced by the headphones. Whether you are a hardworking professional or an extremely busy student, a single listening session at the end of the day could certainly elevate your mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some users have also noted that the midrange is one of those aspects where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIFIMAN HE1000 V2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shines at its best. From highlighting vocals to shaping instrumentals, and from delivering a natural sound to elevating different notes in a song, the headphones elevate the overall listening experience quite impressively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not all, especially when it comes to sound quality. The patented structure, dubbed as “Window Shade” comes with an open back design that is as comfortable to wear as it is effective in enhancing the listening experience. The strategic design has given the headphones such a shape that they steer clear of any troublesome vibrations. The design also eliminates any distortions that are caused due to a headphones’ structure, which is quite noticeable in most commonly used equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, this structural Window Shade design claims to deliver spectacular imaging with exceptional clarity. Users have noted that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIFIMAN HE1000 V2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; holds to this promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even as everyone who has used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIFIMAN HE1000 V2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sings about its sound quality, most of the users mostly complain about the craftsmanship of these high-end headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The headphone comes in a traditional design that comprises silver, gold, and black accents with a suspension headband. Even at being a conventional design, the style is modern and sleek. It is an excellent design in terms of aesthetics, and users don’t seem to have any complaints about the appearance. But they have a lot to say when it comes to the build and its quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The headphones claim to be handcrafted and checked for quality – something that is supposed to be demonstrated in each pair. But according to users, this is not the case. Some users take issue with unwanted scratches on the pairs that they have received, while others speak of detached or poorly attached padding materials that should not be visible in high end headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall packaging and craftsmanship seem to be the only issue that is brought up with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIFIMAN HE1000 V2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But it seems like a big problem for those who are spending a large amount on this equipment for the love of music. With that, not all users seem to complain about build quality. Those who have received perfectly crafted pairs have not had any complaints about the headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIFIMAN HE1000 V2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; somewhat justifies its high price point through superior sound quality. But it doesn’t do complete justice to its cost due to its build issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, the build issues have not been prevalent for most users. If you are looking for headphones that deliver exceptional sound, then you could certainly go for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIFIMAN HE1000 V2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just make sure to contact the manufacturer for warranty and replacement information in case you might end up with a pair that has issues in its built.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alan</name></author><category term="Headphones" /><summary type="html">Real music enthusiasts want quality.

Whether you are an entrepreneur or an entry-level professional, an ambitious student, or a hardworking artist, listening to some great music is never out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, the music is that one thing in the world that could very quickly make you feel a ton of emotions depending upon the genre. Only by choosing an artist or a type of music, would you feel relaxed, motivated, reflective, or soothed in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This notion is all the more profound when your music is delivered free of distortion, latency, and muffled sounds. That is why you must choose hardware that provides you with superior sound quality, impressive imaging, and crystal clear notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-4 Over Ear Headphones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; rise to the challenge with a promise to meet these requirements with ease. For the most part, these high-end headphones also succeed by an impressive margin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; comes with one of a kind nano-scale diaphragm that is lighter than air. Yes, you read that right. The diaphragm is so thin and light that this level of excellence in diaphragm development is exclusive to Audeze. In real-world terms, it promises the most accurate bass response among any commercial headphones on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, the diaphragm also allows the headphones to provide better imaging during playtime. What’s even better is that these claims are strengthened by users’ reviews, who support Audeze’s superiority in sound delivery through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;LCD-4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diaphragm’s abilities are further enhanced by the magnet array technology included in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;LCD-4&lt;/a&gt;. With Double Fluxor Magnet Arrays, the headphones provide exceptional magnetic flux to an astounding 1.5 Tesla. This concept translates into a fantastic performance by offering more excellent resolution and a massively improved transient response as compared to its counterparts. The quality that these features add to the sound delivery is heavily noted by those who use the headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What further adds to the nano-scale diaphragm and the magnet arrays of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is its Fazor Elements. The technology, which has been patented by Audeze, is proficient in guiding soundwaves to provide a clearer and accurate waveform. Users note that this translates to the headphones projecting the overall sound quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made with ebony wood and leather ear pads, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sport a sleek yet industrial design that makes the headphones a delight to behold. Each of the pair is meticulously handcrafted in Audeze’s California facility, with the proximity providing the company with full control over its manufacturing and quality assurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users note that these features add up to make these headphones “possibly the best in the world.” This notion is essential to note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moniker mentioned above comes from an audiophile who utilized the product and shared their two cents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sound produced by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; remains incomparable to other headphones. A U.S. Army veteran, who utilized the headphones while going through a hearing disability, was awestruck to hear the clarity of the notes through the headphones. This comment stands as a testament to the overall results that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can provide to its users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, the headphones do come at a massively high price tag. To say that they are a significant investment would be an understatement. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is worth it if you value quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with this, the headphones also require a high-quality amplifier to work optimally. Ideally, it should be a combo of an amp and DAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimize for the full experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users also find an issue with the headphones’ weight and the overall comfort that it provides to the user. Some users think that the headphones are too heavy to wear for longer sessions, while others say that they have gotten used to the feeling. But in both cases, users praise the quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; comes with a cryogenically treated premium braided cable. With high quality, silver-plated OCC copper, enjoy uninterrupted sound that comes without any signal loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you love listening to high-quality music and luxury experiences, then getting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is just right. But if budget is an issue, then looking at lower-end or less expensive models would be the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, if you already have an amp or DAC setup or would like to go the whole nine yards with your audio experience, then the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; just might be a no brainer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alan</name></author><category term="Headphones" /><summary type="html">The sound of music is one of the very few things in the world that could draw the favorable attention of anyone regardless of their age, gender, or social setting.

In part because of revolutionary approaches to treating depression hitting the news. Various studies show that party drugs are currently in use for more than their traditional purposes. Helping people heal from past traumas, PTSD, depressions, and more. For example, the promising results from therapies using MDMA add a whole new hue to discussions regarding drug laws and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But did you know people aren’t the only ones who suffer from depression? Your pets can become depressed as well. Especially if they’re living with someone who suffers from depression. Pet depression can be more difficult to spot because pets have difficulty communicating their thoughts and feelings with their people friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cats are one of the most common animals who suffer from depression, and there are several signs to look out for. Do you find your cat sleeping for long periods in the day? Are they restless at night? Do they avoid your attention, or even hide from you? These are all signs that you may have a cat suffering from depression. In years past your only options for treatment would be cute mice on a string, catnip, or feline Prozac. Now you have another option in this new age of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDMA cat therapy is the freshest trend rolling onto the scene. With veterinary clinics offering specialized services all over the country. The times are changing once again and you don’t have to leave the comfort of your own home to participate in this therapy for your depressed cat.  Meowtastic Treats is offering new MDMA cat therapy home kits to help you return the joy to all nine of your cat friends lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Dr. Felidae of the Hoof Art Education Center for Animal Wellness stresses that these treatments are still very new and many of the long term side effects are unknown. She goes on to suggest, “if you notice your cat is listening to electronic music or chasing lasers in excess it might be time to reduce the treatments”. She goes on to say that no treatments are purrrfect, and it’s important to continually monitor your cat throughout the treatments and report any strange behaviors to their vet. The type of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=cat+food&amp;amp;crid=24QEGG45T0F6V&amp;amp;sprefix=cat+food,aps,313&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&amp;amp;linkId=363b411717b7ff69cd50709e16e0a469&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;cat food&lt;/a&gt; your little Simba is eating can also have an impact on their well being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, despite concerns, many people are opting to try these home treatments with successful results. Vicky from Buffalo, New York, is ecstatic with the results so far. “He’s sooooo much more affectionate than he was before. He’s been rubbing against me for the past 8 hours. He only took one break to find a glowing neon collar. I’m still not quite sure where he found it. He’s a whole new cat, and I love him to pieces. The MDMA cat therapy home kit is exactly what he needed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ReviewHuntr gathered cats from all walks of life to conduct our review. House cats living with depressed owners, and owners without depression. Cats that spend their day chasing rats who spend their day chasing cheese. And alley cats who ate trash every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results varied across our subjects. The indoor cats saw the most benefit while alley cats saw marginal improvements. The cat who chased rats wasn’t interested in trying the treatment. But he’s always been kind of lame that way with his collar all tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?k=cat+supplies&amp;amp;crid=35RQI9TE6UTYQ&amp;amp;sprefix=cat+supplies,aps,236&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_12&amp;amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&amp;amp;linkId=a5ebc7efa4f80cf5260343db609ff2eb&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;things you can supply your cat&lt;/a&gt; the most important one is happiness. While it still may be slightly controversial, MDMA therapy for cats has proven to be as effective as its human MDMA therapy trials. With home kits hitting the stores it’s a chance for you to share some happiness with the cats you love.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ReviewHuntr</name></author><category term="sharkbait" /><summary type="html">Depression has become a common topic of discussion for more and more people.

In terms of functionality, Apple is known for their user-friendly products, easy to use but continuously evolving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As technology continues to advance, Apple has remained consistent in what they offer: a clean modern look and feel for all their products, while also providing quality and durability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a surprise, then, that Apple has become a symbol that stands out in between other leader brands. What started as a computer company, is now famous for its phones, music, TV, and even watch technology. They are a solid and reliable, and consumers know they can trust in them to provide fresh yet outstanding products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q1NBCVB/ref=fs_a_md_0&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;27” iMac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; whose main feature is a &lt;strong&gt;Retina 5K&lt;/strong&gt; display, has been in the market since 2014, for almost five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the last iMac product released by Apple (not counting the iMac Pro, released in 2017). However, this doesn’t mean that the 27” iMac Retina 5K is outdated. Far from it, Apple is a company known for a slow approach when designing new hardware. They are notable for spending years trying to perfect their products to make sure that they are the best they can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, one of their Apple designers was quoted in saying: &lt;em&gt;“Our goals are very simple — to design and make better products. If we can’t make something that is better, we won’t do it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the birth of the company, many models have been scrapped and deemed not good enough for release. Apple makes sure their products meet all the requirements and are perfect for release, taking the time (years) before finally releasing them. Therefore, you can be sure that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q1NBCVB/ref=fs_a_md_0&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mac Retina 5K&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is created with the best technology Apple can offer to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model was designed with professional photographers and video editors in mind, with the 5K resolution allowing 4K video to be played at its native resolution in Final Cut Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of storage, it offers the best option in the market so far: space &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; speed. A Fusion Drive, faster and more efficient than its predecessors. The processor is a new seventh-generation Intel Core, offering more speed than any iMac has reached before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, what gives this iMac the name: the Retina 5K Display. With a pixel density so high you can’t detect a single one, to the color accuracy and vibrancy, it’s clearly the best addition so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the reviews have been positive, allowing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q1NBCVB/ref=fs_a_md_0&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;27” iMac Retina 5K&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to reach a rating of 4.5 stars out of 5, with particular interest in the screen quality (rated unanimously 5 stars).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users commented that this model is able to run many apps at the same time without degradation over time. The screen size and resolution has been said to be perfect. The colors are brilliant and sharp. The increased size of the screen allows for the user to have many windows open at the time and switch easily between them. The greater width gives allows for more dock space to keep the user’s most preferred programs available at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speed of the processor has been the focal point of many reviewers, which were left amazed by the upgrade when compared to previous models. The combination of both a good operative system (the High Sierra OS optimizes storage and performance), and the processor both contribute to make the iMac faster and enhance the user’s experience. Graphic designers have commented that the performance is the best they’ve ever worked with. The core processor and Radeon Pro 570x graphics card make both 4K and VR video possible to both view and edit.  The operative system — High Sierra OS — is said to work flawlessly and meet the user’s expectations. The built in speakers have been praised as well for their quality and the vibrant sound they produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iMac comes with a rechargeable Magic Mouse and a rechargeable Magic Keyboard. They charge via lightning cable. The keyboard can be used while it’s charging, but the mouse has received negative comments because the port is underneath and therefore, cannot be used when connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this, a few users said the keyboard is too small and uncomfortable, while the wide majority claimed the keyboard was extremely useful and praised the compact design. The mouse was “too flat” to some reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some negative comments regarding the features, or lack thereof. Some commented the SuperDrive is no longer part of the machine, and the purchase of an external DVD drive is needed if the user wants to read or write DVDs or CDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other thing to pay attention to, is that the new iMac comes with Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) as opposed to older models that used Thunderbolt 2. In this case, an adapter is needed in order to connect and operate the hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this model has been said to be an excellent Apple product. Despite the minor complains, users agree that iMacs are the most reliable desktops. Since their hardware and software are designed by the same company, there are no compatibility problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To attest to the quality of the product, there are also some reviews from users who purchased the iMac five years ago, commenting on the performance and durability, and how it keeps working flawlessly despite the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most buyers go as far as to call the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q1NBCVB/ref=fs_a_md_0&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;iMac Retina 5K&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “the best computer they’ve ever owned.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victoria Blanco</name></author><category term="Computer Monitors" /><summary type="html">It’s no secret that Apple products are always a safe option.

&lt;p&gt;Why wouldn’t it be? Your headphones couldn’t only keep you company through your train, bus or even a long cab ride, but can also make sure that you aren’t disturbing anyone else with your music. Everybody wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from being a savior for you and others over your commute, your headphones could also become that one gadget you can’t live without at home or work. This is true for noise-canceling headphones, which block out the outside world, as well as the annoying, beeps and bloops of many phones, computers, and printers that make for a modern work or study environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good pair of headphones is essential to someone’s day to day comfort, especially if they enjoy electronic entertainment like most of us. I have been using my noise-canceling headphones in and out of work on a daily basis. Nothing beats listening to my favorite music at work or watching my favorite shows or movies at home in complete privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pair of headphones that promise this privacy, as well as excellent sound quality, is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bang-Olufsen-1645146-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B078HPHLPR/ref=sr_1_10&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen B&amp;amp;O Play H8i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sporting a traditional headphone design with high quality, sleek materials, this pair of headphones is a looker. Available in three colors, the headphones uses premium leather, lambskin, and memory foam to promise a comfortable fit for your ears and head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the looks, comfort, and durability, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bang-Olufsen-1645146-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B078HPHLPR/ref=sr_1_10&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;B&amp;amp;O Beoplay H8i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; promises to provide superior sound quality with active noise cancellation (ANC). It also offers complete microphone clarity for voice calls and carries a whopping 30 hours of battery time against a single charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bang-Olufsen-1645146-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B078HPHLPR/ref=sr_1_10&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;B&amp;amp;O Beoplay H8i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has a proximity sensor that stops your music as soon as you take your headphones off of your head and resumes it when you put them back on. The Transparency Mode lets you swing in and out of your surroundings, while the &lt;em&gt;Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen&lt;/em&gt; app lets you choose between different equalizer settings and allows you to turn ANC on and off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feature that is most lauded by the users of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bang-Olufsen-1645146-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B078HPHLPR/ref=sr_1_10&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;B&amp;amp;O Beoplay H8i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; headphones is undoubtedly the sound quality. As I discovered through user reviews, almost every user can’t seem to get enough of their clarity and quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another product feature that turns into a fantastic benefit for users of all types is the battery life. Users comment that the advertised battery time of up to 30 hours seems to reflect quite well in real-time use. Those who have a busy schedule don’t have to worry about charging their headphones every single day. Depending upon the use case, a single charge could last for days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The active noise cancellation (ANC) gets its fair share of praise as well. Since the headphones are built with comfortable material that covers the ears, the passive noise cancellation is already at work. But active noise cancellation takes it to another level, where users can completely tune out from their surroundings. Conversely, turn on the Transparency mode and listen to everyone else actively even while you have your headphones on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that users have noticed is how comfortable it is to wear these headphones. Since they use a mix of premium materials, it is not a surprise. But it is still great to know that someone who likes listening to music all day or binge their favorite TV shows could count on maximum comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not all is well with these headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some users don’t like that it seems to be too pricey. At the same time, I noted that most of the other users seem to be quite content with the features that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bang-Olufsen-1645146-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B078HPHLPR/ref=sr_1_10&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;B&amp;amp;O Beoplay H8i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; offers to them in its price tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another niche complaint comes in the form of build quality. While most users agree that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bang-Olufsen-1645146-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B078HPHLPR/ref=sr_1_10&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;B&amp;amp;O Beoplay H8i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; seems to be made out of comfortable and durable material, some comment that they have a problem with the build quality. But similar to the price issue, this also remains as something that was brought up by minimal people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, other features such as the voice quality over calls and proximity sensor all seem to be getting their fair share of praise. Since the pair of headphones only weighs 7.52 ounces, it is not bulky to wear either, which once again adds to its value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bang-Olufsen-1645146-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B078HPHLPR/ref=sr_1_10&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;B&amp;amp;O Beoplay H8i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent pair of headphones. It is mainly a good fit if you don’t mind wearing a traditional design and could get down with black, pink, and beige colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sound quality and battery timing are undoubtedly the stars of this product. With that, it does come at a steep price for those who have never purchased premium headphones before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with the knowledge that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Bang-Olufsen-1645146-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B078HPHLPR/ref=sr_1_10&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;B&amp;amp;O Beoplay H8i&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides what it promises, you could go ahead with bringing it home as your music and visual entertainment companion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Alan</name></author><category term="Headphones" /><summary type="html">Whether you endure a long commute, or if you simply want to appreciate good music while doing your tasks, having a great pair of headphones could prove to be the answer to your silent prayers.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Neato Robotics D7 Robot Vacuum - Review</title><link href="https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/neato-robotics-d7-robot-vacuum-review/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Neato Robotics D7 Robot Vacuum - Review" /><published>2019-08-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-08-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/neato-robotics-d7-robot-vacuum-review</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/neato-robotics-d7-robot-vacuum-review/">&lt;p&gt;I’m lazy. There, I said it. Although, I tend to prefer the term my mom uses instead: practical. I’m too practical to spend time on things I don’t enjoy or doesn’t make me money. This means that if I can, in any way, make my life a bit easier by automating these &lt;em&gt;impractical&lt;/em&gt; parts of my life I’ll do it. One of those things is cleaning. And what better way to automate cleaning than by having a robot vacuum your floor? However, robot vacuums have built up quite a bad reputation over the years. Why? Because there are just so many and most of them are absolute garbage. So, to save you some time I’ve done some research and found what I believe is the best robot vacuum you can get right now. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Neato-Robotics-Connected-Featuring-Multiple/dp/B078MPFN55/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neato Robotics D7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;specs--features&quot;&gt;Specs &amp;amp; Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who’ve never heard about or seen a robot vacuum in action let’s go over the basics. A robot vacuum is a vacuum and, unsurprisingly, it vacuums your floor. Tired of the word “vacuum” yet? I know I am. It does this by either randomly bouncing around the room or using a smart navigation system to create a path to follow. After it’s done cleaning it’ll either just die on the spot and you’ll have to put it back on it’s charging station, or it’ll return to it by itself. All you need to do is replace the dustbin once it’s full. Those are the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onto the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Neato-Robotics-Connected-Featuring-Multiple/dp/B078MPFN55/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neato Robotics D7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; then. Why do I consider this the best robot vacuum? For starters, unlike other robot vacuums on the market, the &lt;em&gt;D7&lt;/em&gt; is shaped like a capital “D” instead of the usual circular shape (hence the “D” in the name). This allows the vacuum to better fit in to corners, eliminating the need of a large side-brush. The rectangular front of the vacuum also allows for wider roller brushes. Needless to say, this improves efficiency by a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dustbin on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Neato-Robotics-Connected-Featuring-Multiple/dp/B078MPFN55/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neato Robotics D7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has a capacity of &lt;strong&gt;700ml&lt;/strong&gt; (roughly 3 cups) which is the largest dustbin capacity on any robot vacuum I’ve been able to find. This makes it a lot more convenient since you don’t have to empty the bin as often. Adding to the convenience factor, the dustbin is top loaded which makes it much easier to replace compared to the rear or bottom loaded bins on competing products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’re getting to the cool part. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Neato-Robotics-Connected-Featuring-Multiple/dp/B078MPFN55/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neato Robotics D7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is smart. It comes equipped with a LIDAR on top that it not only uses for navigation and obstacle avoidance, but it uses it to make a virtual map of your house. This virtual map is sent to an app that you can get on both Android and iOS devices. The app has a ton of features. Besides allowing you to define rooms (bathroom, living room, bedroom main, bedroom daughter, etc.) it also allows you to create &lt;em&gt;virtual boundaries&lt;/em&gt;. Say you have a bunch of wires somewhere on the floor that you don’t want the vacuum to run over or perhaps you have something in a room that could potentially harm the device. With a lot of robot vacuums, you’d need to put up physical boundaries to prevent it from cleaning those areas. The virtual boundaries in the &lt;em&gt;Neato&lt;/em&gt; app work exactly the same but is much easier and doesn’t take up any physical space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great feature in the app is &lt;em&gt;zone cleaning&lt;/em&gt;. This feature allows you to draw out a zone in the app and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Neato-Robotics-Connected-Featuring-Multiple/dp/B078MPFN55/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neato Robotics D7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will rush over to clean that zone up. So, if there’s just a small area that needs cleaning (say you spilled something) then you won’t have to wait for the vacuum to eventually get to it while going through the entire floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the app and data from previous cleaning sessions the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Neato-Robotics-Connected-Featuring-Multiple/dp/B078MPFN55/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neato Robotics D7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can determine the most battery- and time efficient way to clean your house. It does this by determining how much time and energy it needs to clean the entire house, then it will only charge as much as is needed to finish cleaning the house. Unlike other robot vacuums on the market that will clean the house until the battery runs low and then fully recharge before continuing, this can add &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt; to the cleaning process. Some mid- to lower range devices won’t even remember where it has already cleaned after recharging so if it can’t get the entire house in one charge you’re out of luck. This feature is however only useful if you live in a larger house. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Neato-Robotics-Connected-Featuring-Multiple/dp/B078MPFN55/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neato Robotics D7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has a 120 minutes runtime before it needs to recharge. That’s quite enough for most apartments. My girlfriend and I live in a 30Sq m apartment so the &lt;em&gt;Neato&lt;/em&gt; wouldn’t even need half it’s runtime to fully clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite feature in the app is the ability to schedule cleaning. Say you’re at work between 9 AM and 5 PM, then you could just set up your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Neato-Robotics-Connected-Featuring-Multiple/dp/B078MPFN55/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neato Robotics D7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to clean while you’re gone. Perhaps you only want it to clean certain rooms on certain days, then you can schedule the robot to clean this room on Mondays, that room on Tuesdays, and the entire house on Fridays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Neato-Robotics-Connected-Featuring-Multiple/dp/B078MPFN55/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neato Robotics D7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is compatible with both Google Assistant and Alexa the options for you to automate the robot behavior is practically limitless. You could, for example, use one of those sensors that sense when you’ve been out of the house for more than 30 minutes, to tell the robot to turn on and start cleaning since you’re probably at work or school.
The only feature that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Neato-Robotics-Connected-Featuring-Multiple/dp/B078MPFN55/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neato Robotics D7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is missing is wet mopping capabilities. I, however, don’t think this is a deal break. I’ll touch on why in the next part of this review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;can-a-robot-vacuum-replace-a-traditional-vacuum&quot;&gt;Can a robot vacuum replace a traditional vacuum?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes and no. The sad truth is that robot vacuums are… well… robots. They’re little D- or O-shaped robots that lack any form actual thinking and dexterity. That means if your robot misses a spot or needs to clean an area an extra time because it was just that dirty, it won’t. Once it’s done with it’s cleaning program it’ll go back to sleep on its charger until you tell it go again. If there’s a spot that’s blocked off or for some reason unreachable for the robot then it’ll just ignore that spot. It won’t move the objects that are in the way or angle itself in weird ways to fit in like a human would with a normal vacuum. There are also some messes that are too big for a vacuum that you still have to take care of yourself. Some lower end vacuums can’t even deal with carpets (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Neato-Robotics-Connected-Featuring-Multiple/dp/B078MPFN55/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neato Robotics D7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; handles carpets just fine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, robot vacuums are not fitted for deep cleaning your house. However, it will cut down on the amount of times you need to vacuum yourself. You should vacuum your house &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; once a week, preferably more, to maintain a good living climate. But you’re not really deep cleaning when doing that, are you? So, instead of vacuuming your floors once or twice a week yourself just make your robot vacuum do it &lt;em&gt;everyday&lt;/em&gt; when you’re not home. That way you can cut down on the amount of times that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; need to vacuum to once a month or even less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I don’t think it’s a problem that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Neato-Robotics-Connected-Featuring-Multiple/dp/B078MPFN55/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neato Robotics D7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lacks a wet mopping feature; since you still need to tend your floors yourself you might as well mop the floors while you’re at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to get the best robot vacuum on the market right now, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Neato-Robotics-Connected-Featuring-Multiple/dp/B078MPFN55/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neato Robotics D7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is your best bet. The “D”-shaped design gives it a leg up over the competition and it is slam packed with features that’ll make your life easier. It is one of the most expensive robot vacuums you will find but you get what you pay for. If you, like many others, have used a low-end robot vacuum that has a random cleaning pattern, no smart features like making a virtual map of your home, and can’t handle rugs, and have therefore considered robot vacuums useless, you owe it to yourself to give them another chance. Investing in a high-end robot vacuum like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Neato-Robotics-Connected-Featuring-Multiple/dp/B078MPFN55/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neato Robotics D7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will change your mind.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Simon</name></author><category term="Home" /><summary type="html">I’m lazy.

When streaming new tracks from your favorite artist, the experience remains incomplete without excellent sound quality. I, for one, have never been able to enjoy a game, watch Netflix or listen to Spotify with traditional speakers – and judging by the many reviews I read every day, I am not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, we all have the right proper solution of headphones to save us from the plight of traditional speakers. After all, who doesn’t like to enjoy their games, movies and TV shows in privacy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With technologies such as Bluetooth, AAC, and Sony’s new LDAC that shares wireless sound on higher quality, connecting to a phone, computer, or TV with compatible technology is easier than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t mind the presence of wires, then you could also enjoy surround sound with compatible headphones. All that you need to do is to connect them to your device, and you have your very own auditorium right at your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are just a few of the reasons why wireless headphones with surround sound are becoming so popular among home users who enjoy their games, video, and audio entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Immersive-Cinematic-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B07BDQZ52Z/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze Mobius Premium 3D Gaming Headset with Surround Sound&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is made to serve the needs of those very entertainment aficionados; people like you and I who wouldn’t want anything but the best when indulging in their favorite pastimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Immersive-Cinematic-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B07BDQZ52Z/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze Mobius headset&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; boasts a premium design that is reminiscent of traditional overhead headphones, complete with large over-the-ear speakers padded with memory foam. But that design is perhaps the only thing that is traditional about these headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s because they come with AAC, Bluetooth, and LDAC technology for wireless connectivity, while also having the ability to connect via USB or analog wires and providing 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound to the listener. Another quality that differentiates them is the ability to set up the adaptive sound on computers. This feature is possible by entering your HTRFs and the room size into the application provided by Audeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Immersive-Cinematic-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B07BDQZ52Z/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze Mobius headphones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also come with the feature of being optimized for calls. They are “Discord Certified,” which makes them ideal for multiplayer gaming. With that, they also come with the ability to connect with popular consoles such as PlayStation 4 and Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed using head tracking technology by WAVES Nx, the headsets could provide an immersive gaming experience while playing titles like PUBG - where moving your head lets you explore the map or change your view like never before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted by users, the most sought after feature of the Audeze Mobius headphones is definitely the sound quality. With the ability to provide surround sound that offers an immersive gaming, visual entertainment, and music experience, the headphones are a must-have for those who want to unwind after a long day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bluetooth and LDAC connectivity ensures that users can roam around the house with ease while enjoying the content they have decided to watch or hear. As mentioned by users, the wireless connectivity also seems to be on par with what the price and manufacturer’s claims state it to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature that gets high praise is the comfortable material that is used to craft &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Immersive-Cinematic-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B07BDQZ52Z/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze Mobius&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Since gamers, as well as audiophiles and Netflix bingers, all wear their headphones for a long time, they must meet all the requirements of comfort. Many users comment that these headphones meet this crucial need quite well. The memory foam covering the speakers adds to the support, and it’s replaceable too. Whereas, the headband also boasts a layer of comfortable yet durable memory foam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some users complain that despite being a gaming headset, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Immersive-Cinematic-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B07BDQZ52Z/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze Mobius&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; isn’t for a PS4 or Xbox. Even those who speak highly of the sound quality are quick to mention that the headphones’ surround or 3D feature does not work with their consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They note that they are unable to detect directional sounds in games such as Black Ops 4, where it is essential to know where the opponents’ are. With that, other users have gone as far as to term them as the ultimate gaming headset and seem to have no problems using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On both accounts, nearly all users agree that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Immersive-Cinematic-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B07BDQZ52Z/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze Mobius&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is excellent for being an entertainment headset due to their sound quality. Some have gone as far as to note that even though they bought the headset for gaming, they have kept it to use as an audio and video experience device. Many note that the headphones are easy to connect via all modes and provide excellent passive noise cancellation. All made possible by compelling design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Immersive-Cinematic-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B07BDQZ52Z/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze Mobius Headset&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; seems to be a great purchase even at a high price tag for those who want superior sound quality in their entertainment experiences. Their comfort level and multiple connectivity options, especially the surround sound and LDAC, add to their value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But questions arise when it comes to these headphones’ compatibility with PS4 and Xbox, which is strange considering that they are marketed as overall gaming headphones instead of being made just for PC gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, if you are looking for headphones that are optimal for PC gaming and provide fantastic sound quality, then the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Immersive-Cinematic-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B07BDQZ52Z/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze Mobius&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; might be for you.

You don’t have time to Netflix and chill. You can’t find time to schedule a spa appointment for a little R&amp;amp;R. You don’t even have spare time to give yourself a pep talk. Thankfully, the need for recreation, relaxation, and motivation is met by good music. Those who have a jam-packed calendar would agree sometimes all you must do is play some music and relax. Lose your worries and zone out- or in - for a specific timeframe. But given that you can’t blast your favorite tracks through your commute, at the gym, and work or class, even listening to music could be a difficult task. You’ll need the right equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is where headphones come in. Many people turn to these nifty devices to make sure that they have great music getting them through different parts of their day – all without disturbing anyone. For such professionals and students, having headphones that fulfill the need for privacy without compromising on quality is of the utmost importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/nuraphone-Bluetooth-Headphones-Personalized-Cancellation/dp/B076X4KH11/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;amp;qid=1565733161&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-7&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=mrpowerscript-20&amp;amp;linkId=7aef8cbdeb3b4e885180ce5ce611884a&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nuraphone Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Earbuds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; promise to fulfill that requirement – with a little twist of their own. Even at sporting an overhead design, they have earbuds fitted into the place where a traditional headphone’s speakers are supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe style=&quot;width:120px;height:240px;&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;OneJS=1&amp;amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;source=ss&amp;amp;ref=as_ss_li_til&amp;amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;amp;tracking_id=mrpowerscript-20&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;amp;region=US&amp;amp;placement=B076X4KH11&amp;amp;asins=B076X4KH11&amp;amp;linkId=c6d828b550b58eb27003278a87b7afb7&amp;amp;show_border=true&amp;amp;link_opens_in_new_window=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result? A promise of superior quality active noise cancellation (ANC), personalized sound delivery to cater to your hearing needs, a whopping 20-hour of battery time, and a 12-month limited warranty. Seeing the price tag that the headphones carry, I decided to look into them to save fellow audiophiles the trouble of finding out whether these claims are valid or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, I noted that the one thing customers have praised the most about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/nuraphone-Bluetooth-Headphones-Personalized-Cancellation/dp/B076X4KH11/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;amp;qid=1565733161&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-7&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=mrpowerscript-20&amp;amp;linkId=7aef8cbdeb3b4e885180ce5ce611884a&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nuraphone Wireless Headphones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is their sound quality. Now, that is to be attributed to two things. First, it’s the very structure of the headphones, which uses earbuds instead of overhead speakers. Second, it’s the adaptive sound feature that seems to amaze most of its users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the effectiveness of the design of the earbuds is self-explanatory, it is vital to understand how it works. As noted by most users, the earbuds make sure that the headphones stay in place and delivers consistent quality by being in a fixed position. They also prevent any room for outside noise while offering clear high and low-frequency sounds. This feature makes them ideal for those students or professionals who want consistency in sound quality even as they make their way from one place to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more than the innovative design, it’s the adaptive sound feature that sets &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/nuraphone-Bluetooth-Headphones-Personalized-Cancellation/dp/B076X4KH11/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;amp;qid=1565733161&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-7&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=mrpowerscript-20&amp;amp;linkId=7aef8cbdeb3b4e885180ce5ce611884a&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nuraphone Wireless Headphones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; apart from its counterparts. While other headphones try to deliver the same sound to every person, the &lt;em&gt;nuraphone headphones&lt;/em&gt; come with a built-in customization feature and a native app by the name of NURA. The headphones determine how to deliver sound to each listener according to how they respond to different sound frequencies. As a result, each user of these headphones can get the sound delivery adjusted to the way their ears perceive different sound frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this feature is similar to some headphone adjustment apps available in the market. The EQ in iPhone popularly adjusts the equalizer, while Samsung’s Music app provides adaptive sound similar to nuraphone’s app. But given that the ability to make these changes in nuraphone comes directly from the manufacturer, it gives an edge to the headphones’ hardware and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted by users of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/nuraphone-Bluetooth-Headphones-Personalized-Cancellation/dp/B076X4KH11/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;amp;qid=1565733161&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-7&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=mrpowerscript-20&amp;amp;linkId=7aef8cbdeb3b4e885180ce5ce611884a&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nuraphone Wireless Headphones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it provides listeners with a customized sound quality unparalleled by most headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The active noise cancellation (ANC) feature means that the mobility shouldn’t affect the sound quality. The ANC is expected to block out external noise by adding noise-canceling frequencies actively. For example, it blocks out the incessant chatter of your coworkers or classmates jabbering endlessly about something that doesn’t relate to you, as well as keeping out the sounds of traffic, the constant ringing of office phones, or the clangs and beeps of printers and keyboards around you. As noted by users, this feature also works as intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users comment that the 20-hour battery time also works as expected. As such, whether you have a busy day full of being in front of your computer at work or putting together multiple assignments for school, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/nuraphone-Bluetooth-Headphones-Personalized-Cancellation/dp/B076X4KH11/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;amp;qid=1565733161&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-7&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=mrpowerscript-20&amp;amp;linkId=7aef8cbdeb3b4e885180ce5ce611884a&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nuraphone Wireless Headphones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; would last you more than the full day against a single charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The headphones weigh a mere 11.7 ounces, which makes them quite lightweight despite their traditional design. It has been noted that users who wear them throughout the day feel great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is where opinions start to differ. Those who are not used to earbuds have complained that the design is not very comfortable. Whereas, those who got acclimated with the feeling of wearing earbuds say that they are very much at ease with wearing them all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another slight disadvantage mentioned by users is that the headphones don’t connect to multiple devices at once. While the headphones have Bluetooth, they don’t have a multipoint connection. But this doesn’t seem to bother most users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/nuraphone-Bluetooth-Headphones-Personalized-Cancellation/dp/B076X4KH11/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;amp;qid=1565733161&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-7&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=mrpowerscript-20&amp;amp;linkId=7aef8cbdeb3b4e885180ce5ce611884a&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nuraphone Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Earbuds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; seem to be an excellent choice for those who are looking for innovative design, excellent sound quality, and fantastic battery life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, it is essential to keep in mind that wearing earbuds all day might be stressful for you if you are not used to it. You might need to give the headphones a few hours before you get comfortable wearing them.&lt;/p&gt;

You may not need them right now, but you’ll certainly do at some point. This is somewhat of an unspoken rule everybody subconsciously learned growing up. Lately, with everyone and their grandma having a ton of devices, having a good repair kit has quickly started to become one of those necessities. You never know when one of your devices will break down and you must fix it. Perhaps you want to replace your phone screen or reattach loose components inside a gaming console (both things I’ve had to do just this year). Even if your devices never break (&lt;em&gt;they will&lt;/em&gt;) you might need to assemble something like a custom-built PC. Whatever the case may be, having a repair kit is a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I’ve been using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/iFixit-Pro-Tech-Toolkit-Electronics/dp/B01GF0KV6G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=Pro%27s+kit&amp;amp;qid=1565873996&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&amp;amp;linkId=8e0008b07dcac72597d418b46d799704&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;repair kit from iFixit&lt;/a&gt; since 2015 and I’ve been super happy with it… until a couple of days ago when I stumbled upon the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DB7ZT5P/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&amp;amp;linkId=f6de5cd21708a10262731d2024be56e3&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruputas Wowstick 1F+ Electric Screwdriver and Repair Kit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;electric screwdriver repair kit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with an incredibly stylish design. I. Need. This. In. My. Life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe style=&quot;width:120px;height:240px;&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;OneJS=1&amp;amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;source=ss&amp;amp;ref=as_ss_li_til&amp;amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;amp;tracking_id=reviewhuntr-20&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;amp;region=US&amp;amp;placement=B07DB7ZT5P&amp;amp;asins=B07DB7ZT5P&amp;amp;linkId=1a3c23ca2d53dcc8a133f06297d1e605&amp;amp;show_border=true&amp;amp;link_opens_in_new_window=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DB7ZT5P/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&amp;amp;linkId=f6de5cd21708a10262731d2024be56e3&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruputas Wowstick 1F+ Electric Screwdriver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an electric screwdriver. But not one of those big electric screwdrivers made for building that you’re probably thinking of. This tool is made specifically for device repair. Because of this it doesn’t have to be any larger than your average whiteboard pencil. Unlike any other tool that you put away after use and then have to dig up when you need it, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DB7ZT5P/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&amp;amp;linkId=f6de5cd21708a10262731d2024be56e3&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruputas Wowstick 1F+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has such a sleek, modern design that you might as well leave it on your desk as decoration. In-fact, since &lt;em&gt;Ruputas&lt;/em&gt; include an equally stylish stand for the tool I’m pretty sure that’s what they intend for you to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, let’s be honest. You’re probably not buying an electric screwdriver for the looks. You’re buying it because of its usefulness. So, how good is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DB7ZT5P/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&amp;amp;linkId=f6de5cd21708a10262731d2024be56e3&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruputas Wowstick 1F+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? It has a rated speed of 200rpm and a rated torque of 0.15/3N.M which basically translates to: it’s definitely powerful enough. On top of that, the tip of the tool is equipped with three LED lights which means there’s no need to try get that stupidly far in screw out while simultaneously trying to balance your phone with flashlight on between your chin and chest because the light won’t reach. No, I’m not still salty from the last time this happened. Not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To top it all off the tool is not only useful, powerful, and stylish but also incredibly easy to use. Just pick it up, slip in the bit (or &lt;em&gt;screwhead&lt;/em&gt; as some insist on calling them) and you’re good to go. There’s only one key for you to press. Pressing the bottom part of it will rotate the bit forwards and pressing the top part rotates it back. Now, I’m really only mentioning this because &lt;em&gt;Ruputas&lt;/em&gt; lists this as one of their selling points but, honestly, have you ever seen an electric screwdriver that isn’t this easy to use?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on, the screwdriver itself isn’t the only thing you get with this product…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-wait-theres-more&quot;&gt;But wait! There’s more…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right. Besides getting the screwdriver itself, you’ll get an entire repair kit with everything you’ll ever need. Let’s go through what’s in the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right upon opening the box you’ll be greeted with a &lt;em&gt;magnetic mat&lt;/em&gt; that you can put your screws on to prevent them from rolling away. I cannot stress enough how useful having something like this is. I remember the first time I built a PC and lost more than half the screws because they discretely rolled away. Guess what, I never found them either. Since then I’ve learned my lesson and now I use the good old bowl trick. The problem with putting all the screws in a bowl is that they all get mixed together and it’s difficult to find the screw you need. Placing them flat on a magnetic surface makes it much easier to stay organized when repairing and you won’t need to chase fleeing screws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After removing the magnetic mat you’ll find the screwdriver itself, the stand for the screwdriver, and the other accessories perfectly arranged. Like Tetris blocks. What are these other accessories? As I said, it’s practically all the tools you need in a repair kit. You’ve got a suction cup, a guitar-pick-shaped pry tool and a magnetizer / demagnetizer tool. You’ll also get a storage case where you can throw accessories into when you’re not using them, or you could use it as a traveling case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I know what you’re thinking. “That’s cool and all but wouldn’t the screwdriver be useless without bits (screwheads)”? You’re right, it would. That’s why the screwdriver comes with a whopping &lt;strong&gt;56 bits&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s more than you’ll probably ever need. I’m looking through the list now (which you can find in the Amazon description) and I honestly don’t even know what all of these are. And I’ve done my fair share repairs. They come in three super neat storage tubes that look more practical and definitely takes up less space than the rectangular boxes they tend to come with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you’ll also receive a charging cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-other-people-saying&quot;&gt;What are other people saying?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the Amazon reviews, customers seem to be satisfied with the product. They’ve been praising the design and the practically of the device as well as the include accessories. It seems like the most praised aspects (except the convenience factor) of the kit is the included magnetic mat, the LED lights on the tip of the screwdriver, and the sheer number of bits included in the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real complaint about the product itself I could find was that some feel it is underpower. They want to tighten screws harder than the motor is capable of. Personally, I think this is by design. Quite often when dealing with sensitive components you don’t want to tighten the screws too hard because that could cause damage. Therefore, the screwdriver tightens hard enough for most cases and if you want it to be extra tight then you need to tighten it more manually. That being said, I’ve seen several reviews of the device as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSBFCx59fF8&quot;&gt;videos where the device has been used&lt;/a&gt; and it looks like the screwdriver will be able to tighten screws hard enough in 99% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another complain I’ve seen is the fact that the device charges using Micro USB instead of USB-C and… yeah that sucks. But in all honesty, it doesn’t really matter. It fully charges in 40 minutes anyway. My Kindle and Bluetooth speakers all charge using Micro USB and while it is slightly annoying having to have an extra cable for devices like this, you’ll get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One odd quirk I haven’t seen mentioned in any reviews is the fact that the stand for the screwdriver doesn’t charge it. It’s just a stand. Again, it’s just a minor inconvenience and doesn’t make it any less of an amazing tool but it’s odd and worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a repair kit at home for all your devices is quickly becoming as much of a necessity as having a tool kit, sewing kit, and first aid kit. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DB7ZT5P/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&amp;amp;linkId=f6de5cd21708a10262731d2024be56e3&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruputas Wowstick 1F+ Electric Screwdriver and Repair Kit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is seemingly the perfect one. Not only do you get and extremely stylish electric screwdriver, but you also get essential repair tools as well as 56 different bits (screwheads).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend picking this kit up. Even if you don’t need it now you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; need it in the future. Best to be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

You may not need them right now, but you’ll certainly do at some point. This is somewhat of an unspoken rule everybody subconsciously learned growing up. Lately, with everyone and their grandma having a ton of devices, having a good repair kit has quickly started to become one of those necessities. You never know when one of your devices will break down and you must fix it. Perhaps you want to replace your phone screen or reattach loose components inside a gaming console (both things I’ve had to do just this year). Even if your devices never break (they will) you might need to assemble something like a custom-built PC. Whatever the case may be, having a repair kit is a no-brainer.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Yamaha P45 - Digital Piano Review</title><link href="https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/yamaha-p45-digital-piano-reivew/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Yamaha P45 - Digital Piano Review" /><published>2019-08-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-08-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/yamaha-p45-digital-piano-reivew</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/yamaha-p45-digital-piano-reivew/">&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re just taking your first steps into the music world, or you already own a keyboard but you’re considering upgrading to a better one… there are some things you might want to consider before purchasing a new digital piano. First, the size of the keyboard, or more precisely, the number of keys. This will determine the higher and lower notes you’ll be able to reach. If you’re a beginner, you might be tempted to buy a small one, thinking you won’t be reading notes way above or below the middle staff. However, you’ll soon find yourself somewhat limited if your keyboard has less than five full octaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full-size keyboard has 88 keys (52 white keys and 36 black keys), like a real piano. At first, a beginner might not use the top or bottom octave much, but in time they’ll be extremely useful. For the small increase in price, the extra notes are well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important factor is the size of the keys themselves. A standard piano key is about 2.3cm wide, but cheaper or smaller keyboards will usually have narrower keys as well. This might seem not important, but if you get used to smaller keys, it’ll be harder to play other pianos that have different-sized ones. By making sure the keys in your keyboard are standard, you’ll be able to apply your talent in other pianos, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most crucial thing to look for in a digital piano, is the way it feels when pressing down on the key. You’ll probably want to feel the key similar to that of a traditional piano. Even though there are no hammers or strings inside a digital instrument, most manufacturers will design the mechanism of the keys in order to compensate for the lack of leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good pivot will determine the amount of force it takes to press the keys and produce the sound. Most &lt;strong&gt;Yamaha&lt;/strong&gt;’s models have been praised for this, as they usually have the pivot point in a position that’s comfortable for the pianist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To imitate the feel of an acoustic piano, manufacturers use some variation of what is known as weighted action. It basically makes the keys feel more like the keys on a traditional piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-88-Key-Weighted-Digital-P45B/dp/B00UJ9LNDK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=mrpowerscript-20&amp;amp;linkId=efb39a70206386fe095dc917afd29e46&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yamaha P-45B&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in particular, is a weighted hammer-action simulated piano, heavier in the low end and lighter in the high end, just like an acoustic piano. This allows it to respond best, especially to velocity variation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe style=&quot;width:120px;height:240px;&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;amp;OneJS=1&amp;amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;amp;source=ss&amp;amp;ref=as_ss_li_til&amp;amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;amp;tracking_id=mrpowerscript-20&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;amp;region=US&amp;amp;placement=B00UJ9LNDK&amp;amp;asins=B00UJ9LNDK&amp;amp;linkId=5311f18d385181f51a641f8641da4a0a&amp;amp;show_border=true&amp;amp;link_opens_in_new_window=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, without weighted action, the keys on the keyboard would be “easier” to play, since it would feel more like an organ and less like a piano. This will give you an advantage, since it’s easy to move to an organ when you’re used to weighted action keys, but not so much in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this, most reviewers said that the weight of the keys and response feels like a real piano. Similar to this, other users said that the weighted action keys are great, and couldn’t tell any difference from a real piano. However, they also commented that the sound is good, but not great. The dynamic range has also been a point for concern. Although the keys are touch sensitive, the difference in volume between pounding on them and lightly touching them has been noted to be different to what you find on a real piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other buyers had a different view on this aspect, and commented that the sound you can obtain with the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-88-Key-Weighted-Digital-P45B/dp/B00UJ9LNDK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=mrpowerscript-20&amp;amp;linkId=efb39a70206386fe095dc917afd29e46&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yamaha P-45B&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is very realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minimalist approach of the keyboard has also been praised. The reduced number of buttons give the piano a cleaner and less cluttered look. There’s also less voice options when compared to other models—only 2 grand pianos, 2 electric pianos, 2 organs, 2 harpsichords, 1 strings and 1 vibraphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The users considered this to be beneficial, since most pianos would have a ridiculously large variety of extra tunes rarely used. Most pianists will likely toggle between the acoustic piano, electric piano and organ. Even though it might be fun one or two times, you won’t need to play your piano with a tuba sound very often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another positive point of the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-88-Key-Weighted-Digital-P45B/dp/B00UJ9LNDK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=mrpowerscript-20&amp;amp;linkId=efb39a70206386fe095dc917afd29e46&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yamaha P-45B&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is that the speakers are facing down out of the bottom of the piano, instead of up, as is common in most designs. This allows for the sound to come out richer and less like it’s a plastic toy keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comes with very useful functions, like a metronome, and customizable preferences for reverb type and depth. But perhaps the most wanted option is the two-person mode, which splits the keyboard in half and duplicates the octaves, each with their own sound. This is a great feature because it lets the user play a bass line with the left hand while playing chords and/or a melody with the other, all the while using different sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also comes with a power adapter and sustain pedal. The latter is a particularly important thing to look for when searching for a digital piano or keyboard. Not every keyboard comes with one, and it might be a deal breaker for most pianist, as it is virtually impossible to play in modern styles without one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, despite some users commenting that the quality of the sound is not the best, most agree that even though it might sound not like a real piano, it gets really close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a full-size weighted-hammer action keyboard, this is a really good option considering that similar keyboards can cost well over $1000. So, if you’re looking for a good-quality keyboard that’s also low-budget, the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-88-Key-Weighted-Digital-P45B/dp/B00UJ9LNDK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=mrpowerscript-20&amp;amp;linkId=efb39a70206386fe095dc917afd29e46&amp;amp;language=en_US&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yamaha P-45B&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will meet all your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
