With free multiplayer, cheaper games, and better graphics there’s no surprise thousands of people are looking to make the switch to PC. However, building your own PC is not for everyone, as it requires some degree of research and preparation. Not everyone can spare their valuable time for researching and selecting components to eventually build a PC. This is why pre-built systems like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/CyberpowerPC-Xtreme-i5-9400F-GeForce-GXiVR8060A7/dp/B07PKXQBHN/ref=sr_1_3&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; exist, they offer anyone a chance to get into PC gaming without the other hassles of building and testing your own computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/CyberpowerPC-Xtreme-i5-9400F-GeForce-GXiVR8060A7/dp/B07PKXQBHN/ref=sr_1_3&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features 3 RGB fans mounted at the front. These are large 120mm fans capable of pushing serious air into your computer, keeping it cool under any amount of stress. The rear of the computer features a single RGB 120mm fan. You might assume that having only 1 fan at the back is for cost efficiency, but that is not the case. By having an imbalance of air pressure at the back, CyberPower manages to create negative air pressure, which greatly increases the cooling ability and speed of the air entering the system. All fans are customizable in colour, with a remote provided to go through the various lighting modes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appearance is important, and when you are priced just above 800$, you better show it. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/CyberpowerPC-Xtreme-i5-9400F-GeForce-GXiVR8060A7/dp/B07PKXQBHN/ref=sr_1_3&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is no stranger to aesthetics, with its RGB fans managing to blend seamlessly into the inky black of the case. Red trim around the case adds a layer of ‘class’ if you will. It features 1 stick of 8GB DDR4 ram, painted with a beautiful crimson to blend in with the build. The motherboard is a deep black, with everything connected to it following a similar colour pattern. Most computers are blessed with beautiful interiors, yet they are never shown. These beautiful interiors are locked inside a metal prison, with no eyes able to truly enjoy them. This case has a tempered glass side panel, allowing everyone to see the beautiful interior of your computer. This computer is beautifully designed and put together, something all users can agree on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connection is important, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/CyberpowerPC-Xtreme-i5-9400F-GeForce-GXiVR8060A7/dp/B07PKXQBHN/ref=sr_1_3&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; delivers. At the front, it features 2 super-fast USB 3.0 ports, mic and audio ports, and a power/reset button. This is an impressive array, yet it pales in comparison to what the computer holds in its rear. It has 6 USB 3.0 ports, 2 USB 2.0 ports, 7.1 audio ports, and an extremely fast ethernet port. You may be wondering what to fill up those USB ports with, well CyberPower has you covered! When you purchase the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/CyberpowerPC-Xtreme-i5-9400F-GeForce-GXiVR8060A7/dp/B07PKXQBHN/ref=sr_1_3&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; you receive a free keyboard and mouse. The mouse has 4 programmable buttons and features variable lighting. The keyboard is also well made, with red accents on often used keys. In general, the ports peripherals on this PC were very well received by users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything I’ve discussed pales in comparison to what really matters, performance! This is the true test of whether the computer has enough power to meet the demand of its users. It features a 6 core I5-9400 CPU capable of handling just about anything you throw at it. The CPU has a base clock of a respectable 2.9 GHz, but the turbo is where it shows its true potential. This CPU manages to get up to 4.1 GHz, able to crush tasks like video rendering and gaming with ease. The graphics card is no weakling either, its a full-sized GTX 1660 with 6GB of video memory. This graphics card crushes all games at 1080p, however, you might have trouble running max settings above that resolution. The graphics card is by far the weakest point of this build, holding the CPU back in demanding tasks. However, most users will never face this as it becomes apparent in only the most demanding tasks. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/CyberpowerPC-Xtreme-i5-9400F-GeForce-GXiVR8060A7/dp/B07PKXQBHN/ref=sr_1_3&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features a 120GB Solid State Drive that is many times faster than a traditional HDD, yet it also has a 1 Terabyte hard-drive for all your major files. This interesting storage setup allows for windows to run on a blazing fast low storage SSD, while all the large files stay on the huge hard-drive. The performance is easily the most well-received part of this computer, with almost every user prasing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/CyberpowerPC-Xtreme-i5-9400F-GeForce-GXiVR8060A7/dp/B07PKXQBHN/ref=sr_1_3&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a superb computer capable of handling almost anything its users throw at it. Everything including and under 1080p gaming is lightwork for this computer. The design of this computer and the free peripherals make it an eyecatcher in any room. CyberPower also gives a 1-year warranty on this computer, so you’ll always have peace of mind. Overall, this computer is definitely deserving of its 4.7-star rating on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>7</name></author><category term="Computers" /><summary type="html">The allure of PC gaming is stronger than ever in these subscription service ridden days.

For most parents, they have to lug around bulky car seats and a separate stroller anytime they have to be on the go. This can get tiring pretty quick. It’s basically an upper body cardio workout! The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&amp;amp;refinements=p_36%3A30000-&amp;amp;rnid=386430011&amp;amp;s=baby-products&amp;amp;sr=1-6&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doona Infant Car Seat &amp;amp; Latch Base&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a nifty game-changer released by the company &lt;em&gt;Simple Parenting&lt;/em&gt;. This car seat is the first that can also transform into a stroller! Is that a dream come true or what? Well, maybe not quite, but it does seem to be the time and energy saving solution for parents. Customers report ease of usage with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&amp;amp;refinements=p_36%3A30000-&amp;amp;rnid=386430011&amp;amp;s=baby-products&amp;amp;sr=1-6&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doona car seat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with mothers who frequent public transport heaving a sigh of relief over the foldability and portability of this car seat-stroller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&amp;amp;refinements=p_36%3A30000-&amp;amp;rnid=386430011&amp;amp;s=baby-products&amp;amp;sr=1-6&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doona seat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; comes in 10 colors and has a minimalistic design, transforming into a compact stroller with just a push of a lever. Parents who have busy lives and errands to run are absolutely smitten with this feature. Your purchase comes with the infant car seat base. It also comes with an extensive list on how to properly install and use the seat. Buyers shared that it also comes with a recall-list paper that you can get registered on and you can get notified in case of leaving your baby accidentally in the car. A car seat protector is also in the package, in case of spills or other accidents. The infant insert and the head supporting cushion are made with bamboo fabric. Youtube tutorials give you guidance on how to set it up and get started. It is recommended by customers to use it on your own before putting baby in it in order to get a feel for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&amp;amp;refinements=p_36%3A30000-&amp;amp;rnid=386430011&amp;amp;s=baby-products&amp;amp;sr=1-6&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doona&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also meets FAA standards, which means you can bring this with you on a plane. It saves you storage space in your car and your apartment. Buyers agree that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&amp;amp;refinements=p_36%3A30000-&amp;amp;rnid=386430011&amp;amp;s=baby-products&amp;amp;sr=1-6&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doona&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is simple and easy to maneuver, even one handed. This is a nice quirk for people who like to sip coffee on the go, or have to hold on to the sibling’s hand. Some people have commented on how heavy the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&amp;amp;refinements=p_36%3A30000-&amp;amp;rnid=386430011&amp;amp;s=baby-products&amp;amp;sr=1-6&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doona&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; weighs when you pick it up. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&amp;amp;refinements=p_36%3A30000-&amp;amp;rnid=386430011&amp;amp;s=baby-products&amp;amp;sr=1-6&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doona car seat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; weighs 15 pounds. Most moms say they’d pick some extra strength expenditure for the benefit of having what equals to a convertible car seat. As a stroller, it is reported to be easily maneuvered through aisles, restaurants, city corners, and airplanes. It comes with an insert to support newborns, and the canopy over the head extends downwards. Wheels are reportedly durable for both sidewalk and grassland walks and the one-touch brakes are described to be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a car seat, which it is primarily, it comes equipped with some safety features in place. A 5- point safety harness makes sure your baby is good and secure in his crib. The handles also serve as anti-rebound bars. The wheel enclosure have a double-wall structure, which gives a 3 layer Side Impact Protection, with EPS foam layers. Once you decide to convert it into a stroller, you just pull up the handle and you’re good to go. The position of the handlebar is low enough that the older sibling can take over the duty of switching the seat into the stroller. The car seat is virtually impossible to fold accidentally. Neither will the handle pop out in carry mode. These safety features were designed keeping in mind both the parents as well as the baby. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&amp;amp;refinements=p_36%3A30000-&amp;amp;rnid=386430011&amp;amp;s=baby-products&amp;amp;sr=1-6&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doona’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Infant Insert was designed specially in order to support and cradle newborns in their first month of life, by engineers and medical professionals. It is an almost flat design which ensures that the baby’s neck and back are in alignment ergonomically. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&amp;amp;refinements=p_36%3A30000-&amp;amp;rnid=386430011&amp;amp;s=baby-products&amp;amp;sr=1-6&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doona car seat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the only one to have been certified as a car seat and a stroller that provides complete safety for your little one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&amp;amp;refinements=p_36%3A30000-&amp;amp;rnid=386430011&amp;amp;s=baby-products&amp;amp;sr=1-6&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doona seat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can handle up to 35lb of weight and up to 32 inches in height. It is rear facing, and not forward facing, which some customers wished it was. Buyers have reported that they need to buy separate accessories as it has no space, baskets, or under the stroller storage for milk and water bottles or other small things. Accessories that the company offers separately alongside the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&amp;amp;refinements=p_36%3A30000-&amp;amp;rnid=386430011&amp;amp;s=baby-products&amp;amp;sr=1-6&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doona&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; include rain covers, snap-on storage, sunshade, an essentials bag and an all-day bag. But if you want to bypass all of that, you can simply buy a bike bag as a quick fix to carry around your diapers and wipes, as shared by one mom in an Amazon review. The only other major setback with this handy seat is the price tag. Some people are skeptical of shelling out $500 for something their baby will outgrow. Some people don’t travel about enough for this seat to be handy. But the majority customers agree that the investment is worth it for those moments of ease, convenience, and flexibility. No separate travel system in place required, you just pop the wheels of the Doona and secure it in place. &lt;strong&gt;A must-have for parents that value their time and are on the go.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>11</name></author><category term="Parenting" /><category term="Baby" /><summary type="html">Taking care of a newborn can be hard and even more so with families that travel regularly.

It is a no-brainer to use, and requires no in-depth understanding apart from, well, running. When we talk about treadmills for home use, there is a wide variety out there ranging from awful to fantastic. That’s a broad spectrum. For someone who is looking around to buy one, this can get tedious very fast. This review is going to cover not one, but 2 treadmills of one of the most reliable brands out there, &lt;em&gt;NordicTrack&lt;/em&gt;. The 6.5S and 6.5Si are the current popular offerings and this review touches both briefly to help out a potential cardio bunny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NordicTrack fitness is a home equipment staple. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/NordicTrack-NTL17915-6-5-Treadmill-World-class/dp/B0193V3DJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;T series 6.5S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one of the company’s least expensive home use treadmill, which makes it a great choice for home buyers. There’s a console that gives 20 workout programs for complete novices. This variety ensures you don’t get bored with the same old. It offers fat loss, LISS and HIIT programs, among others. If you have a subscription to the iFit program, it comes with access to the app, which opens the gateway to more workout programs. If you decide to purchase this treadmill, you get a free 30-day subscription to iFit. Features include heart rate monitoring, FlexSelect Cushioning, where you control the cushioning effect of the running belt, and is foldable. The LCD is backlit, has a music port and 2-inch speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting off with some cons first, for seasoned runners, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/NordicTrack-NTL17915-6-5-Treadmill-World-class/dp/B0193V3DJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;6.5S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; only has an incline of 10%. Therefore, if you are a runner on the more advanced side, you might choose to skip this purchase. Coming to what Amazon reviewers think of this equipment, it seems that you cannot use the treadmill unless you sign up for iFit. To get around this, buyers report holding down the iFit logo for 30 seconds. This was one of the biggest disadvantage users had a problem with, as this feature is not made aware to you when purchasing. Other cons include treadmill not having a cool down fan, or space to put in your phone or keys, which some people found off-putting. However, there are cup holders on each side. It is a larger piece of equipment, hence it requires at least 2 people to assemble. Assemble time was reported at an average of 30 minutes. The machine is described as being heavy to handle, and cannot fit through doors, so consider setting up in a place you wouldn’t want to move from again. In case of faulty equipment, most people found the customer support services absymal. The hassle of cancelling an iFit subscription was not worth it to many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to some positives, the build of the treadmill is reported to be sturdy and not shaky, even at higher incline and speeds. It was described as not being hard to set up, even if you tried doing it alone, although that will take longer as per helpful reviewers. Speed changes can be increased in fractional speeds in 10ths for 10 levels. A hydraulic system is built into the machine. It locks in place once you push it high enough. To move the treadmill part, you will need to depress the lever. Once the descent starts, you can let it touch the ground gently on its own, thanks to the hydraulic system. It works the same way once you want to push it upwards. This is a great plus for people who do not want to, or cannot, struggle with a heavy treadmill every time they want to exercise. There is a wedge in the main console where you can set an iPad, should you need to. Regarding noise levels, the reviews are in the favor of not as noisy as you would expect such heavy, big equipment to be. If you are an avid runner or marathon trainer, or simply cannot find the time to go to gym or run, this piece of equipment is described to give you what you need, a solid cardio workout at a solid price point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/NordicTrack-NTL17915-6-5-Treadmill-World-class/dp/B0193V3DJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;6.5Si T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series treadmill has similar features to the 6.5S, with the addition of a larger display screen serving as a console. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/NordicTrack-NTL17915-6-5-Treadmill-World-class/dp/B0193V3DJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;6.5Si&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has a 10 inch screen that is interactive. With the purchase of this treadmill, you get a 1 year subscription to iFit, whereas the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/NordicTrack-NTL17915-6-5-Treadmill-World-class/dp/B0193V3DJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;6.5S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gives you one month only. It also has a 2.6 CHP motor, which allows for more power than other treadmills in the range. A very neat feature allows the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/NordicTrack-NTL17915-6-5-Treadmill-World-class/dp/B0193V3DJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;6.5Si&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; technology to show a trainer on screen that can control your machine’s incline level and speed. This one also has a library of 20 workout programs which feature world class level fitness trainers to guide you through. The treadmill belt length is 55’’. Another addition to this treadmill are non-flex rollers, along with the predecessor’s patented FlexSelect cushioning, which allows for non-jerky treadmill movements.

For someone who is looking around to buy one, this can get tedious very fast. This review is going to cover not one, but 2 treadmills of one of the most reliable brands out there, NordicTrack. The 6.5S and 6.5Si are the current popular offerings and this review touches both briefly to help out a potential cardio bunny.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Destroy the Amazon rainforest for charity with Amazonian wood clothing - Review</title><link href="https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/amazon-wood-clothing-review/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Destroy the Amazon rainforest for charity with Amazonian wood clothing - Review" /><published>2019-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/-amazon-wood-clothing-review</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/amazon-wood-clothing-review/">&lt;p&gt;After a hard time trying to figure out a way to help save the amazon following weeks of insane deforestation and colossal fires, this new line of clothes entirely made out of Amazonian wood wants to make a big entrance into the ecological design market -and they did it-.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From wooden pants to vine shoes and leaf-made t-shirts, entrepreneur and designer William Treecut explained his proposal to save the amazon rainforest: “I got tired of seeing all those Instagram influencers, only sending their thoughts and prayers after those alarming fires. So I thought ‘well, maybe the lungs of the planet need some big-ass bucks to finally catch some breath’. Then I started to create a profitable business out of this, where we allow people to finally give their money to something that will help rebuild the amazon, while also looking amazing for their crying pictures. 95% of our earnings go to the countless ONGs that are seeking funds to recover the rainforest, and 5% to repair the chainsaws that get damaged while extracting the product to make our finest clothing”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their system is simple: cut down the trees, make awesome clothes, then donate the funds to plant more trees. At first, the idea seemed a little bit unethical, and many ONGs and Instagram celebrities —like Rudy Bega— Immediately expressed their skepticism about the whole initiative. As Mr. Bega explained, “I don’t know if this will help the amazon at all, but if I can get a taste of this product for free, I’ll probably promote it as well. Please check my new video”. But as Hare O’Daiorama, president of Greenpeace explained: “it was literally the only decent proposal”. He praised the projections made out by Treecut, specifically stating that “the cost-benefit graphic had a lot of ecologic green color on its design -so it had to be a sustainable idea”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We approached the company and bought a whole lot of new outfits to test their quality. The wooden pants were the first choice: although their design was a little old-fashioned —which was the main intention, as the design can easily pass as the pants of a Victorian armor—, we found that having little mobility and itchy crotches weren’t something we could get used to. A similar thing happened with the leaf t-shirt: the leafs caused an allergic reaction on our team, wreaking havoc all across the newsroom. Surprisingly, the premium line of oak and pine tree t-shirts and pants felt comfy, and its hipster design stood up for the enormous expectations that we had with this clothing line (and its price. We ran out of money to afford a writer for this article).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we know, hipster-culture is a fusion of several preferences, such as dressing in vintage clothing, holding pacifist and green views, and having a desire of moral superiority on most of the current topics of modern society. And this clothing line seems to have everything in its favor to shake the grounds of society. As Treecut explained, “there’s no more vintage thing than using designs inspired in the 1600’s era or something more pacifist than the sound of a chainsaw in the middle of the Amazon”. The company is also exploring other options to please the needs of a public that is hungry for justice: a honey bee pure, a new line of white shark teeth’s kitchen knives, and a very interesting product: a brand-new line of shoes made out of the skin of endangered species, that will certainly create consciousness about animal hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our verdict: the oak and pine tree t-shirts and pants were stylish, but not very useful for runners. We’ll wait for the honey bee puré and the shark teeth kitchen knives to see if things can get more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>9</name></author><category term="sharkbait" /><summary type="html">After a hard time trying to figure out a way to help save the amazon following weeks of insane deforestation and colossal fires, this new line of clothes entirely made out of Amazonian wood wants to make a big entrance into the ecological design market -and they did it-.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Canon EOS Rebel T6 Digital SLR Camera Kit with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II Lens (Black) - Review</title><link href="https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/canon-eos-rebel-t6-digital-slr-camera-kit-review/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Canon EOS Rebel T6 Digital SLR Camera Kit with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II Lens (Black) - Review" /><published>2019-08-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-08-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/canon-eos-rebel-t6-digital-slr-camera-kit-review</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/canon-eos-rebel-t6-digital-slr-camera-kit-review/">&lt;p&gt;Have you ever considered indulging in photography? Once a person has mastered the basics, it is something that pays off in the long run. You can capture memories beautifully and re-visit them over again. However, you may have found yourself overwhelmed with all the choices out there. These days, there are so many options for the average everyday user and it gets harder to decide what to pick. Once you decide to check out the options, you might find your enthusiasm waning due to confusion about what to buy. I thought I’d make it easier for you by reviewing one of the most beginner-friendly cameras out there, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CO2JPYS/ref=dp_cr_wdg_tit_nw_mr&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Canon EOS Rebel T6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rebel T6 has a plastic body and is one of the more lightweight models available, with a weight of no more than 3lbs. According to Amazon reviews, customers were surprised to find out how small in size the &lt;em&gt;T6&lt;/em&gt; is, with it being described as “one of the smallest you can buy among DSLRs”. This is positive feedback for people who would not want to lug around a heavy camera around their neck or shoulder for trips to the mountains or the beach. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CO2JPYS/ref=dp_cr_wdg_tit_nw_mr&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Canon EOS Rebel T6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, unlike its predecessor &lt;em&gt;T5&lt;/em&gt;, comes with WiFi connectivity and a Digic 4+ processor, a step up from the basic Digic 4 processor and lack of WiFi connectivity. There are all the basic beginner modes available, like landscape, portrait and sports. For people looking to have more creative control, there are manual settings you can fiddle with, like aperture and shutter. The T6 is on the cheaper side of the DSLR range, costing around $550. The camera has been described by Amazon buyers as “very user friendly” and the added extra of WiFi connectivity is great for the people who want to upload their pictures to social media on the go. Hence, as an everyday camera, it is a good option to consider. For events and trips, automatic mode is reported to be good enough to do the job. If you plan on practising, there is a wide range of manual settings and modes provided. In the back, there is an LCD screen which has been described by buyers as having a better resolution than the previous model. For newbies, there is an added feature to help out in manual mode. When one wants to fiddle with the DSLR in manual mode, a brief description will show up on screen for guidance and information. This helpful feature can also be turned off in case you have been watching too many Youtube tutorials. This aspect of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CO2JPYS/ref=dp_cr_wdg_tit_nw_mr&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Canon EOS Rebel T6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been well appreciated among Amazon reviewers. The camera is part of a kit which also includes 2 basic entry-level lenses for a variety of photographic needs. If you own any existing lenses, buyers have found that majority of lenses are compatible with this camera. You will need to buy your own SD card for storage of pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we talk about some of the cons, the lack of touch-screen on the LCD panel on the back of the camera left some buyers frustrated. Another problem customers found off-putting was the fact that the LCD screen is fixed and cannot be flipped back. For photographers who are not entirely new to the DSLR scene, they will be disappointed to know that the ISO feature is automatic and you cannot change it even in manual mode. If you change other manual settings, the camera will set its own ISO. Some users shared that the camera’s shutter speed was a bit slower than average, taking up to 5 seconds to capture a photo. Others were disappointed to find that the camera did not perform up to par at capturing high-speed events, even in sports mode. One of the most shared sentiment about this camera, as reported by Amazon buyers, was that it was not as excellent in the video department, compared to photograph only. Issues with autofocus was a major complaint. The camera frequently beeped which meant it could not focus adequately on the subject and therefore, would not capture. If you want a camera for vlogging, this is not a good option for you as there is no jack for an external microphone. An in-depth user manual is also not provided in the box, and users have had to go searching online for instructions. Other major negative setbacks reported among users is that the camera’s WiFi will not work if the cable is attached to the computer. Apart from that, it was reported by some customers that WiFi will connect to users’ smartphones, but not laptops or computers. Make of that what you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmingly, users were quite pleased with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CO2JPYS/ref=dp_cr_wdg_tit_nw_mr&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Canon EOS Rebel T6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; regarding its functionality and price tag. For beginners, this is a highly recommended DSLR that does not require one to shell out big bucks. It is viewed as a very good choice for someone who wants to dabble in the field of photography as a hobby. It is also a good piece of equipment to learn the basics on. The Canon T6 won’t burn a hole in your pocket, is simple to use and easy to learn, and takes great photos as shared by Amazon buyers. Overall, it is viewed as great value for your money, user-friendly and a nice entry level option.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>11</name></author><category term="Cameras" /><summary type="html">Have you ever considered indulging in photography?

This dream isn’t possible to realize without a graphics card that can push back against the rising demands of newer games. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GeForce-GTX-1080-GAMING/dp/B01HHBQBLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSI Geforce GTX 1080&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the perfect card for any PC gamer, and with enough features to win anyone over, there’s no shock in its hefty 4.4 star rating on Amazon. It was voted best graphics card in the European Union in 2016 and has sold over 20 million units worldwide. You can’t argue with numbers like those!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GeForce-GTX-1080-GAMING/dp/B01HHBQBLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSI Geforce GTX 1080&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; boasts two beefy fans connected to multiple copper heat pipes to keep it running cool. Users have expressed that the stock fan settings are insufficient, but this is an issue easily fixed using MSI’s own utility (MSI Afterburner). This card is outfitted with Torx 2.0, MSI’s newest cooling technology. Torx 2.0 manages to achieve 22% higher air pressure by utilizing software and hardware improvements. The fans use an innovative dispersion style that allows for air to better flow throughout the card. The fans are supported by double ball bearings to guarantee silent operation under any condition. If you don’t find the stock solutions up to your needs, you can always install a custom water loop to cool your computer. The card’s surface is covered in inky black paint with beautiful red accents that highlight cooling fins. LED lights are installed on this card which allows for users to match lighting effects with their builds colour. This card can blend aesthetically into any build. The cards general appearance and fans are received with an appraisal from most users as it offers more than just a plain card aesthetically speaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance is what truly matters, and this card packs enough for anyone. Its capable of high-resolution gaming, live streaming games, and even handling multiple security cameras feeds! On its stock settings this card runs at around 1750mhz, impressive but not something most people will be blown away by. However, when yous start overclocking this card, that’s when you really begin to feel its true power. Many users have managed to get this card near 2000hz, a beastly number. Cooling these behemoths is important, as without it they would throttle down and lower their clock speed. Again, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GeForce-GTX-1080-GAMING/dp/B01HHBQBLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSI Geforce GTX 1080&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is well prepared. Its dual-fan setup allows for temperatures to stay in the 80s even at 100% usage. The fans focus on cooling the 6 large copper heat coils connected to the main GPU, so there is always cooling going to critical components. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GeForce-GTX-1080-GAMING/dp/B01HHBQBLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSI Geforce GTX 1080&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; boasts an impressive 8 gigabytes of hyper-advanced GDDR5X graphics memory. This card’s performance was revered at its debut in 2016, yet it still easily contends with most major cards today. The general user consensus is that this card easily and reliably achieves its performance targets, whilst also having the ability to exceed them thanks to its overclocking software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GeForce-GTX-1080-GAMING/dp/B01HHBQBLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSI Geforce GTX 1080&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; manages to easily overcome anything modern games can throw at it. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GeForce-GTX-1080-GAMING/dp/B01HHBQBLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSI Geforce GTX 1080&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; manages to run nearly every modern at Ultra settings, but as technology moves forward, 4k is not the bleeding anymore. Modern gamers are now hard-pressed to get that exhilarating rush achieved only by running their favourite games at graphical levels nearing real life. This rush is now achieved by experiencing their favourite games in Virtual Reality. Virtual Reality is now the bleeding edge of video games and requires a beefy graphics card to avoid the all too common motion sickness when games arent run properly. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GeForce-GTX-1080-GAMING/dp/B01HHBQBLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSI Geforce GTX 1080&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; easily meets and exceeds the requirements for virtual reality, and can run any virtual reality game on the market with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the card is definitely marketed towards gamers, with styling to match, it can do so much more. Video editors marvel at the cards rendering speed and optimization which makes video editing, in general, a breeze. This card fully supports SLI which allows for users to run to of these cards together, essentially doubling performance. Frequent driver updates and software support from MSI ensures that this card won’t fall behind. The card has lots of surprising uses, so it is sure to fit anyone’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GeForce-GTX-1080-GAMING/dp/B01HHBQBLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSI Geforce GTX 1080&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a rock-solid all-around graphics card that can handle anything you throw at it with ease.

Since their origins, they have allowed us to carry out significant processes capable of simplifying multiple tasks, and over time, these have even become a source of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the exponential technological advances of recent years, and the emergence of different technologies, desktop computers are no longer the only option the market offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple professionals, students and day-to-day users have discovered how comfortable and efficient laptops can be, — in part because they can be transported from one place to another with ease moreover because they continue to improve by leaps and bounds —, to the point that some may even surpass several desktop models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are one of the many users who enjoy the advantages that a laptop can provide, this is an article for you, especially if you want to know various details related to a computer somewhat “powerful”; that you could use to spend long days playing demanding video games without sacrificing any performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a beginner and don’t know how specific components work, or how they can be superior to others, don’t worry, as I’ll, in detail, explain the elements that make the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/PH315-51-78NP-Acer-Predator-Helios/dp/B07CTHLX8C/ref=sr_1_7?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;amp;crid=A23T4V16A9N7&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an excellent
choice for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/PH315-51-78NP-Acer-Predator-Helios/dp/B07CTHLX8C/ref=sr_1_7?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;amp;crid=A23T4V16A9N7&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features a 15.6” FHD IPS screen with a refresh rate of 144Hz, an Intel i7-8750H processor, a GTX 1060 6GB GPU, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB NVMe SSD, and Aeroblade Metal Fans PH315-51-78NP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the above makes this model an excellent choice. According to different reviews, it can be considered a high-performance laptop with outstanding performance concerning its price range. Despite having unique components, its price is around $1200, which makes it relatively accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The powerful components in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/PH315-51-78NP-Acer-Predator-Helios/dp/B07CTHLX8C/ref=sr_1_7?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;amp;crid=A23T4V16A9N7&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer Preditor helios 300 Gaming Laptop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is probably the laptops biggest draw. Let’s go through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the screen, this model has a 15.6” FHD IPS screen that provides wide viewing angles and excellent color accuracy. The 144hz refresh rate ensures an incredibly smooth gameplay experience — although, to take full advantage of this functionality you’ll need to play at a high enough FPS which means that the performance could vary according to the game and the configurations applied to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 might not be the latest and greatest (that title goes to the RTX 2080 Ti, which is more expensive than this entire laptop) but it’ll be more than enough for your gaming needs. No, you won’t be able to play the latest AAA titles with all settings maxed out in 4K and with 250 fps but, if you turn down the settings just a little you’ll be able to run them smoothly. As for competetive games like Overwatch, CS:GO, and Dota 2 you’ll have nothing to worry about, let the graphics shine and the frames be high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Intel i7-8750H will make sure you have all the processing power you’ll need. Whether you’re trying to render out a YouTube video, building a scene in Unity, or just editing a photo you’re laptop won’t slog. The 16 GB of DDR4 RAM will also help to make sure your experience is as fast and smooth as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of aesthetics, the laptop consists of plastic and metal parts and a non-mechanical keyboard - which, according to different buyers, is one of the best non-mechanical keyboards on the market - with different luminous gadgets that make it somewhat “unique”. Despite being a slightly heavy laptop — approximately 5.51 lbs — many users have defined it as a comfortable piece of equipment to carry and even state that it is relatively light compared to other gaming laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the pros there are some cons that have been frequently mentioned by users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laptop has somewhat limited storage with it’s modest 256 GB. However, the laptop does support expandable storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laptop has significant problems of overheating which will effect both the gaming experience and performance in general — as such, overheating brings with it a considerably decreased fps in demanding games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now, multiple solutions have been proposed by different users, the most common being to purchase a cooling pad, make use of the cool boost function integrated in the laptop itself, or even undervolting the CPU to prevent it from overheating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the above and the significant problem of overheating, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/PH315-51-78NP-Acer-Predator-Helios/dp/B07CTHLX8C/ref=sr_1_7?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;amp;crid=A23T4V16A9N7&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer Preditor helios 300 Gaming Laptop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a great laptop, and most users in their reviews have agreed that it has an excellent quality-price relationship that makes it an outstanding choice for those who want to get an incredible gaming laptop for a friendly sum of money concerning the quality of its components, because its small problems can be solved with a little extra investment that will not require a budget higher than $1300, while most of the laptop gaming in the market easily exceed that price.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>8</name></author><category term="Laptops" /><summary type="html">Computers have gradually become an essential part of our lives.

I own a Windows 10 HP PC myself - in fact, its the very one I’m using to write this review. But enough about the company brand itself, let’s talk about a certain product of theirs and dive into its features, quality, and general reception amongst buyers. Today, we’re reviewing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HP-15-6-inch-Dual-Core-MaxxAudio-Bluetooth/dp/B07QKWTZ4B/ref=sr_1_5&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2019 HP Premium HD Laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Sold online at the very popular Amazon retail shopping website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Released on April 10, 2019, this personal laptop has managed to rank #60 in amazon’s “Computers and Accessories” category; as well as scoring #6 in Traditional Laptop Computers. It’s to say this tech tool is not under the radar - and one you won’t have trouble finding in Amazon’s search results. But, it is on the cheaper side of the competition. Selling for a measly $349.00, which does include free shipping. With that in mind, this laptop can be interpreted best as a “budget” product, with a “Get what you pay for” type of situation. So remember to keep that in mind before adding this to your laptop wishlist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for specs, it isn’t indecent. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HP-15-6-inch-Dual-Core-MaxxAudio-Bluetooth/dp/B07QKWTZ4B/ref=sr_1_5&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2019 HP Premium HD Laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is lightweight, making it a better option for those who don’t like carrying around a heavy object in their backpack or briefcase. However, it is on the larger side in terms of screen-size - which is a solid 15.6 inches. Though, this does mean you won’t have to worry about a small-screen; especially if you hate squinting. Other notable specs would be its OS, which is running 64-bit Windows 10, the fact it supports both WIFI and Bluetooth connectivity, and that it a has useful 8GB of ram. Which on paper, makes it sound like a pretty good buy if you need a cheap laptop for school or work purposes. But before reading any further, let’s take a rain-check on that idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rated 3.7 out of 5 stars, and sitting at 116 total reviews. The consumer opinion of this device seems to be relatively positive, with a tad bit of negativity thrown in the mix. But, don’t let that fool you into making an impulsive decision. After reading through a multitude of more recent reviews, I seem to get the idea that this product is not all that it’s “cracked” up to be. Several reviewers have claimed that their device has arrived defective or not-working, such as this review by Katherine L. Others have included a sentiment of dissatisfaction with their experience, many claiming that their copy of the laptop had slow processing speeds, and consistent periods of delays and freezes; both of which can severely bother someone if their on a schedule. This review coincides with the report of delay, noting that the product has trouble with opening files and apps; something I would consider a bit of a turn-off when said product claims to have an 8 gig RAM. Amazon user ifrah comments that his 2019 HP HD is horrendous, making it almost impossible to get such simple tasks done such as browsing and basic homework needs. So far, the reviews seem to tell a different story than the advertised “premium” quality. But, that’s not to say there aren’t some positive reviews. Eric’s sentiment goes with my earlier statement of this laptop being a “budget” product. Once again starting with the recurring argument of lag and delay, he goes on to however say it works decently for basic word applications and streaming sites, and that you do get what you pay for; an opinion we seem to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the overall responses I’ve gathered about this product, many people seem to agree on one almost universal opinion. This laptop is a decent cheap buy for somebody who needs something basic, like a middle school or high school student. But other than that, it has some real issues that need to be addressed by the manufacturers. Especially if some of their shipments are arriving broken or defective to a portion of their customers. Quality over Quantity is a motto that everyone who hopes to be successful in this business should follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rate this a personal 2.5 out of five stars, as it does have some neat features and long battery life. But if you’re looking for something fast and productive for long-term projects, or maybe just your everyday job. Then I would consider looking elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

I know this for a fact. Not only do I regularly interact with self-identified audiophiles, I can easily claim to be one myself. I love immersing myself in music. I’d never be able to work out of an office that banned headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may digress, but good music is to an audiophile what a good book is to a bookworm. If you find an artistic work that you like you can go back to it, again and again, to find new meaning in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By repeat listening sessions of their favorite music, audiophiles can identify notes and ranges that they weren’t able to discover before. Doing so brings about a feeling of accomplishment, exhilaration, and recreation. As such, it serves as a great way to unwind for music lovers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to feel this profoundly enjoyable experience, you need listening equipment that is capable of bringing the best out of your music and highlight everything on the recording.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the reason why high-end headphones remain extremely popular among the “music 1%” (those who truly believe in listening to music as a hobby). With specialized design, materials, and functions, these headphones could elevate your music experience, unlike other audio equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you think of these high-end headphones, the Audeze LCD line instantly comes to mind. With the best design, material, and function features, these headphones remain a class apart. One of the most popular models from the series, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-3 Over Ear Headphones with Fazor Elements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, remains a prime example of excellence in audio equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the company’s popular Fazor Elements, that claim to deliver soundwaves flawlessly, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; headphones come with ultra-thin yet large diaphragms. These diaphragms promise the delivery of powerful bass, clear top-end, and targeted midrange. The headphones also boast of double-sided magnetic arrays which claim to make distortion a thing of the past. The planar magnetic technology, on the other hand, aims to deliver a natural and accurate sound that highlights every single note on a recording.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted by users, all of these features make for a pair of headphones that deliver consistently compelling, clear, and flawless sound during each listening experience. Anyone who has used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cannot stop highlighting the astoundingly high quality of its sound — a factor that remains prevalent in all kinds of recordings and music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users also note that this level of sound quality and consistency is possible due to the way that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The headphones are handcrafted and promise superior building processes to complement their high-quality sound. Built using leather suspension headband and ear pads, sturdy steel frame, maple wood rings, and braided cable, the headphones give off the unmistakable air of luxury while also bringing in durability as one of their other prime characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides aesthetics and strength, this build also reflects on the overall sound quality that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; users rave about. Each earpiece on the headphones comprises of multiple layers of high-quality material, which aims to provide a superior listening experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, the housing itself is made out of carefully picked and polished maple wood and durable steel. It is joined by Audeze’s lighter-than-air diaphragm, neodymium magnets, and Fazor Elements, before being topped off by the leather earpad. Users note that this results in headphones that come with the qualities of clarity, accuracy, and exceptional waveform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; headphones line comes with different types of wood rings. As mentioned above, this particular edition uses maple as the choice of wood, which looks exceptional against the jet black color of the main structure as well as the silver accents on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks as wonderful as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who want to keep these premium headphones safe between use or who want to carry them around to use at their convenience, the headphones come with a sturdily-built travel case. This aspect ensures that whether you are traveling by bus or taking a personal car, your headphones remain safe from any impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted by users, this focus on material and safety reflects very well on the headphones’ build quality. The headphones are highly durable and built with the notion to last their owners for years. Users note that the headphones’ structure conveys this idea very clearly. This aspect also means that the headphones are fabulous for those who don’t want to shell out premium pricing for replacement headphones every couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weighing just 1.4lbs, the headphones remain quite light as compared to other high-end models. A few users complain about only being able to wear them for a couple of hours a day, but others mention that they are comfortable to wear for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; headphones come with a 1-year warranty on cosmetic parts and accessories, as well as a 3-year warranty on drivers. The hardware warranty is subject to manufacturer deficits. But as noted by users, the Audeze LCD-3 remains free of hardware issues and comes with a high-quality finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-3 Over Ear Headphones with Fazor Elements and Maple Wood Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are a fantastic addition to any audiophile’s music library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price tag might seem high, but its design and sound quality make them justify their cost quite quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in the market for a pair of headphones that are just as rich in sound quality as it is in its looks, then your search might end with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audeze LCD-3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>6</name></author><category term="Headphones" /><summary type="html">Audiophiles know that nothing may surpass good music.

It is not just a want. They desire phenomenal quality. As I have noticed in my own experiences, this holds true regardless of the type of person. The audiophile may be a working professional or a student who happens to love music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that no one could attend a live concert with exceptional sound quality every single day, the objective of a consistently astounding listening experience seems impossible to achieve. But as demonstrated by high-end headphones, it isn’t that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the kind of music you like, a great pair of headphones could be the difference between drearily hearing a distorted song and thoroughly enjoying a crystal clear performance. By simply upgrading your listening equipment,  find new life in old songs. You may also discover fresh notes that you previously missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not unveil the best parts of new music right from the get-go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIFIMAN HE1000 V2 Headphones with Planar Magnetic Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; promises to check all of these boxes, and then some. They are pricey, alright. But the significant part about these headphones is that they undoubtedly fulfill their claims of delivering excellent sound quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boasting the use of the world’s first-nanometer diaphragm, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIFIMAN HE1000 V2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also features an advanced asymmetrical magnetic circuit, a patented structure for natural soundstage, and manual craftsmanship for high-quality design. When combined, these features come together to offer sound quality that is natural and distortion-free. For those upgrading from lower-range headphones, it promises to turn their listening experience around for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nanometer diaphragm in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIFIMAN HE1000 V2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is supposed to deliver faster response while keeping distortion at bay. As noted by those who have used these headphones, the thin diaphragm does its job impressively. The sound produced by these headphones delivers crisp, bright, and vibrant tunes at every session. No matter the genre of music, the headphones’ sound quality remains notably natural and reminiscent of a great live listening experience. This notion means that if you are one to enjoy music without the restriction of the genre, these headphones would be a perfect match for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advanced asymmetrical magnetic circuit, which uses a double-sided design, works together with the nanometer diaphragm to elevate the distortion-free listening experience even further. The feature also translates into real-world use effectively and provides users with a midrange that is free of any reflections or deflections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted by users, this is once again evident in the sound quality produced by the headphones. Whether you are a hardworking professional or an extremely busy student, a single listening session at the end of the day could certainly elevate your mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some users have also noted that the midrange is one of those aspects where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIFIMAN HE1000 V2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shines at its best. From highlighting vocals to shaping instrumentals, and from delivering a natural sound to elevating different notes in a song, the headphones elevate the overall listening experience quite impressively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not all, especially when it comes to sound quality. The patented structure, dubbed as “Window Shade” comes with an open back design that is as comfortable to wear as it is effective in enhancing the listening experience. The strategic design has given the headphones such a shape that they steer clear of any troublesome vibrations. The design also eliminates any distortions that are caused due to a headphones’ structure, which is quite noticeable in most commonly used equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, this structural Window Shade design claims to deliver spectacular imaging with exceptional clarity. Users have noted that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIFIMAN HE1000 V2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; holds to this promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even as everyone who has used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIFIMAN HE1000 V2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sings about its sound quality, most of the users mostly complain about the craftsmanship of these high-end headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The headphone comes in a traditional design that comprises silver, gold, and black accents with a suspension headband. Even at being a conventional design, the style is modern and sleek. It is an excellent design in terms of aesthetics, and users don’t seem to have any complaints about the appearance. But they have a lot to say when it comes to the build and its quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The headphones claim to be handcrafted and checked for quality – something that is supposed to be demonstrated in each pair. But according to users, this is not the case. Some users take issue with unwanted scratches on the pairs that they have received, while others speak of detached or poorly attached padding materials that should not be visible in high end headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall packaging and craftsmanship seem to be the only issue that is brought up with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&amp;amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIFIMAN HE1000 V2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But it seems like a big problem for those who are spending a large amount on this equipment for the love of music. With that, not all users seem to complain about build quality. Those who have received perfectly crafted pairs have not had any complaints about the headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
