      <p>From playing games to enjoying high definition movies and TV shows on your screen, sound quality is everything. When streaming new tracks from your favorite artist, the experience remains incomplete without excellent sound quality. I, for one, have never been able to enjoy a game, watch Netflix or listen to Spotify with traditional speakers – and judging by the many reviews I read every day, I am not the only one.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we all have the right proper solution of headphones to save us from the plight of traditional speakers. After all, who doesn’t like to enjoy their games, movies and TV shows in privacy?</p>

<p>With technologies such as Bluetooth, AAC, and Sony’s new LDAC that shares wireless sound on higher quality, connecting to a phone, computer, or TV with compatible technology is easier than ever.</p>

<p>If you don’t mind the presence of wires, then you could also enjoy surround sound with compatible headphones. All that you need to do is to connect them to your device, and you have your very own auditorium right at your home.</p>

<p>Those are just a few of the reasons why wireless headphones with surround sound are becoming so popular among home users who enjoy their games, video, and audio entertainment.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Immersive-Cinematic-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B07BDQZ52Z/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze Mobius Premium 3D Gaming Headset with Surround Sound</em></strong></a> is made to serve the needs of those very entertainment aficionados; people like you and I who wouldn’t want anything but the best when indulging in their favorite pastimes.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Immersive-Cinematic-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B07BDQZ52Z/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze Mobius headset</em></strong></a> boasts a premium design that is reminiscent of traditional overhead headphones, complete with large over-the-ear speakers padded with memory foam. But that design is perhaps the only thing that is traditional about these headphones.</p>

<p>That’s because they come with AAC, Bluetooth, and LDAC technology for wireless connectivity, while also having the ability to connect via USB or analog wires and providing 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound to the listener. Another quality that differentiates them is the ability to set up the adaptive sound on computers. This feature is possible by entering your HTRFs and the room size into the application provided by Audeze.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Immersive-Cinematic-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B07BDQZ52Z/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze Mobius headphones</em></strong></a> also come with the feature of being optimized for calls. They are “Discord Certified,” which makes them ideal for multiplayer gaming. With that, they also come with the ability to connect with popular consoles such as PlayStation 4 and Xbox.</p>

<p>Developed using head tracking technology by WAVES Nx, the headsets could provide an immersive gaming experience while playing titles like PUBG - where moving your head lets you explore the map or change your view like never before.</p>

<p>As noted by users, the most sought after feature of the Audeze Mobius headphones is definitely the sound quality. With the ability to provide surround sound that offers an immersive gaming, visual entertainment, and music experience, the headphones are a must-have for those who want to unwind after a long day.</p>

<p>Bluetooth and LDAC connectivity ensures that users can roam around the house with ease while enjoying the content they have decided to watch or hear. As mentioned by users, the wireless connectivity also seems to be on par with what the price and manufacturer’s claims state it to be.</p>

<p>Another feature that gets high praise is the comfortable material that is used to craft <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Immersive-Cinematic-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B07BDQZ52Z/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze Mobius</em></strong></a>. Since gamers, as well as audiophiles and Netflix bingers, all wear their headphones for a long time, they must meet all the requirements of comfort. Many users comment that these headphones meet this crucial need quite well. The memory foam covering the speakers adds to the support, and it’s replaceable too. Whereas, the headband also boasts a layer of comfortable yet durable memory foam.</p>

<p>But some users complain that despite being a gaming headset, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Immersive-Cinematic-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B07BDQZ52Z/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze Mobius</em></strong></a> isn’t for a PS4 or Xbox. Even those who speak highly of the sound quality are quick to mention that the headphones’ surround or 3D feature does not work with their consoles.</p>

<p>They note that they are unable to detect directional sounds in games such as Black Ops 4, where it is essential to know where the opponents’ are. With that, other users have gone as far as to term them as the ultimate gaming headset and seem to have no problems using them.</p>

<p>On both accounts, nearly all users agree that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Immersive-Cinematic-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B07BDQZ52Z/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze Mobius</em></strong></a> is excellent for being an entertainment headset due to their sound quality. Some have gone as far as to note that even though they bought the headset for gaming, they have kept it to use as an audio and video experience device. Many note that the headphones are easy to connect via all modes and provide excellent passive noise cancellation. All made possible by compelling design.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Immersive-Cinematic-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B07BDQZ52Z/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze Mobius Headset</em></strong></a> seems to be a great purchase even at a high price tag for those who want superior sound quality in their entertainment experiences. Their comfort level and multiple connectivity options, especially the surround sound and LDAC, add to their value proposition.</p>

<p>But questions arise when it comes to these headphones’ compatibility with PS4 and Xbox, which is strange considering that they are marketed as overall gaming headphones instead of being made just for PC gaming.</p>

<p>With that, if you are looking for headphones that are optimal for PC gaming and provide fantastic sound quality, then the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-Immersive-Cinematic-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B07BDQZ52Z/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze Mobius</em></strong></a> might be for you. Available in copper and blue, these could be an excellent addition to the home of any entertainment enthusiast.</p>
