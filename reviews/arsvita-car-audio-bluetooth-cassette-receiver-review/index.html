Do you not like local radio stations, or get tired of not having music on demand? More importantly, does your car only have a tape player? Since most bands stopped putting out tapes sometime in the early 2000s, having the ability to play them in your car isn’t seen as such a big positive anymore. And, if you can’t afford to replace the entire stereo, it can seem like you’re stuck with the oldies and that random tape of the Oakridge Boys that somehow made its way into that one tucked-away box of junk that never gets thrown out. CDs, too, are going the way of the dinosaur, so those old adapters don’t work as well anymore. But the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QSW6KNY?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Arsvita Car Audio Bluetooth Cassette Receiver</a></span> seems to be a good choice in overcoming this hurdle, and getting your favorite tunes playing again!</p><h3 id="what-is-it">What Is It?</h3><p>Simply put, it’s the modern equivalent of the adapters used to play CDs with only a tape deck. Here, the tape-shaped adapter is placed into the player, leaving the transmitter outside. Then, you can simply connect your device wirelessly via Bluetooth to play music, listen to podcasts, or even listen to audio-books as you drive! A tool like this is often a necessity for older cars, since they usually lack a hook up for modern technology. This works for practically all devices capable of a Bluetooth connection. Anything from iPods to smartphones, even to computers and tablets, can be used by this device. The cassette receiver is rechargeable, with an 8 hour long active battery time. That increases to over 160 when switched to standby mode. Being wireless, you’ll also be spared having cords running from your phone or device directly into your stereo.</p><h3 id="who-should-use-it">Who Should Use It?</h3><p>There are two main categories of people who would do well with this product. The first are those who enjoy collecting and driving antique (or just older) cars. Often, dream cars from the 80s only came with a tape player, as nothing else was available at the time. Not only can changing out the entire stereo system be expensive, you also risk ruining any interior work during the process. If you’ve managed to preserve the original, that could be a nightmare. Instead, an adapter such as this can make it possible to play music in a modern way, using modern equipment. The second group of people are those who are driving an older car out of necessity. Whatever the reason, a complete stereo replacement is expensive, as mentioned above. Instead of completely replacing what already functions, you could simply use this product to overcome the problem.</p><h3 id="interesting-features">Interesting Features</h3><p>Without a doubt, the most interesting feature of the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QSW6KNY?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Arsvita Car Audio Bluetooth Cassette Receiver</a></span> is directly in its name: Bluetooth. Unlike similar cassette adapters, this one is capable of connecting to your devices via Bluetooth. This saves a lot of hassle. Instead of having to manually plug in your phone or mp3 player every time you get into the car, it can automatically connect for you! Since your phone won’t have to leave wherever you normally store it while driving, such as your purse, a stand, or even just a cup holder, you’ll be less likely to leave it behind. You’ll also get rid of all of the bulky cords that seem to only clutter up the area and take up space. Do you take calls while driving? You can with this! Being hands-free is a safe way to keep up communication on the go, and this product offers it.</p><h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3><p>On Amazon, a majority (70%) of the comments were very high, rating five stars for this product. It has been reported to work very well by quite a number of different customers. The cassette receiver seems to function as intended, giving users the ability to listen to music and other audio through older speakers in their car using this. One buyer in particular was happy to find that older speakers “can now be converted to Bluetooth speakers with this versatile tool.” The way that the product looked was highly praised, as well. It’s fairly small, and not bulky. The lack of wires means that it doesn’t clutter up the area around your stereo. Many have described it as “sleek”, which is something a lot of those who are proud of their cars aim for. On the whole, the product seems to function well, look nice, and please buyers.</p><h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3><p>While there are a lot of good reviews, 13% of the reviews for the product are only one star. That, behind the five star ratings, is the highest percentage of the ratings. Many of the negative reviews seem to have similar problems. The most common of these are that the cassette simply ceases to work after a few weeks. They claim no damage to the product, only that it randomly died. Some have had the Bluetooth stop working on them. One user in particular mentions that, while it works well, he’s already had to buy two, because the others malfunctioned. A handful of people complain about the quality, saying that there was either a lot of background noise, or a constant humming while it was playing. A few of those who bought one have said that it was repeatedly ejected by their tape player, so couldn’t get it to work at all. To their credit, the company is prompt in discussing solutions, including full refunds, with those that had these problems.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>So, what do we make of the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QSW6KNY?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Arsvita Car Audio Bluetooth Cassette Receiver</a></span>? With all of the facts, it seems to be a fairly nice choice for anyone who wants to listen to modern music in an antique car. The good reviews dwarf any of the bad ones. There are some problems with it, but the company seems to be on top of the matter when it comes to righting any wrongs. All-in-all, it’s a great purchase to make.</p><hr><div> ReviewHuntr is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to amazon.com.</div><div class="page-footer"><div class="page-share"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Arsvita Car Audio Bluetooth Cassette Receiver - Review&url=https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/arsvita-car-audio-bluetooth-cassette-receiver-review/" title="Share on Twitter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Twitter</a> <a href="https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/arsvita-car-audio-bluetooth-cassette-receiver-review/" title="Share on Facebook" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Facebook</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/arsvita-car-audio-bluetooth-cassette-receiver-review/" title="Share on Google+" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google+</a></div><div class="page-tag"><a href="https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews#Bluetooth+Adapters" class="tag"># Bluetooth Adapters</a><a href="https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews#Car+Accessories" class="tag"># Car Accessories</a></div></div></div></div> </article></div></div><script>!function(e,t,a,n,c,s,o){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,s=t.createElement(a),o=t.getElementsByTagName(a)[0],s.async=1,s.src=n,o.parentNode.insertBefore(s,o)}(window,document,"script","https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-121890486-4","auto"),ga("send","pageview")</script><script type="application/ld+json">
