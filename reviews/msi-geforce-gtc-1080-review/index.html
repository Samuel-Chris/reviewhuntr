      <p>It’s no secret that every PC Gamer dreams of playing their favourite games at max settings, whilst having their computer barely break a sweat. This dream isn’t possible to realize without a graphics card that can push back against the rising demands of newer games. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GeForce-GTX-1080-GAMING/dp/B01HHBQBLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>MSI Geforce GTX 1080</em></strong></a> is the perfect card for any PC gamer, and with enough features to win anyone over, there’s no shock in its hefty 4.4 star rating on Amazon. It was voted best graphics card in the European Union in 2016 and has sold over 20 million units worldwide. You can’t argue with numbers like those!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GeForce-GTX-1080-GAMING/dp/B01HHBQBLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>MSI Geforce GTX 1080</em></strong></a> boasts two beefy fans connected to multiple copper heat pipes to keep it running cool. Users have expressed that the stock fan settings are insufficient, but this is an issue easily fixed using MSI’s own utility (MSI Afterburner). This card is outfitted with Torx 2.0, MSI’s newest cooling technology. Torx 2.0 manages to achieve 22% higher air pressure by utilizing software and hardware improvements. The fans use an innovative dispersion style that allows for air to better flow throughout the card. The fans are supported by double ball bearings to guarantee silent operation under any condition. If you don’t find the stock solutions up to your needs, you can always install a custom water loop to cool your computer. The card’s surface is covered in inky black paint with beautiful red accents that highlight cooling fins. LED lights are installed on this card which allows for users to match lighting effects with their builds colour. This card can blend aesthetically into any build. The cards general appearance and fans are received with an appraisal from most users as it offers more than just a plain card aesthetically speaking.</p>

<p>Performance is what truly matters, and this card packs enough for anyone. Its capable of high-resolution gaming, live streaming games, and even handling multiple security cameras feeds! On its stock settings this card runs at around 1750mhz, impressive but not something most people will be blown away by. However, when yous start overclocking this card, that’s when you really begin to feel its true power. Many users have managed to get this card near 2000hz, a beastly number. Cooling these behemoths is important, as without it they would throttle down and lower their clock speed. Again, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GeForce-GTX-1080-GAMING/dp/B01HHBQBLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>MSI Geforce GTX 1080</em></strong></a> is well prepared. Its dual-fan setup allows for temperatures to stay in the 80s even at 100% usage. The fans focus on cooling the 6 large copper heat coils connected to the main GPU, so there is always cooling going to critical components. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GeForce-GTX-1080-GAMING/dp/B01HHBQBLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>MSI Geforce GTX 1080</em></strong></a> boasts an impressive 8 gigabytes of hyper-advanced GDDR5X graphics memory. This card’s performance was revered at its debut in 2016, yet it still easily contends with most major cards today. The general user consensus is that this card easily and reliably achieves its performance targets, whilst also having the ability to exceed them thanks to its overclocking software.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GeForce-GTX-1080-GAMING/dp/B01HHBQBLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>MSI Geforce GTX 1080</em></strong></a> manages to easily overcome anything modern games can throw at it. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GeForce-GTX-1080-GAMING/dp/B01HHBQBLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>MSI Geforce GTX 1080</em></strong></a> manages to run nearly every modern at Ultra settings, but as technology moves forward, 4k is not the bleeding anymore. Modern gamers are now hard-pressed to get that exhilarating rush achieved only by running their favourite games at graphical levels nearing real life. This rush is now achieved by experiencing their favourite games in Virtual Reality. Virtual Reality is now the bleeding edge of video games and requires a beefy graphics card to avoid the all too common motion sickness when games arent run properly. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GeForce-GTX-1080-GAMING/dp/B01HHBQBLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>MSI Geforce GTX 1080</em></strong></a> easily meets and exceeds the requirements for virtual reality, and can run any virtual reality game on the market with ease.</p>

<p>Although the card is definitely marketed towards gamers, with styling to match, it can do so much more. Video editors marvel at the cards rendering speed and optimization which makes video editing, in general, a breeze. This card fully supports SLI which allows for users to run to of these cards together, essentially doubling performance. Frequent driver updates and software support from MSI ensures that this card won’t fall behind. The card has lots of surprising uses, so it is sure to fit anyone’s needs.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>In conclusion, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GeForce-GTX-1080-GAMING/dp/B01HHBQBLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>MSI Geforce GTX 1080</em></strong></a> is a rock-solid all-around graphics card that can handle anything you throw at it with ease. It features innovative new technology to meet and exceed all your expectations. The performance is on par with many of today’s most innovative cards, and easily withstands the test of time. Coming in at just under 800$, its mostly meant for enthusiasts or high-performance users that need to squeeze every ounce of energy from their systems.</p>
