It holds true just as much for music creators and sound engineers as it does for audiophiles and music enthusiasts.</p><p>When it comes to high-quality equipment, it must ensure a trouble-free rendition and lifelike listening experience for its users. After all, every creator wants their work to translate accurately for the listener, and every listener wants the utmost quality from each second they devote to their music.</p><p>That is where professional-grade headphones come in. With their unique structure, premium materials, and exceptional craftsmanship, they provide a listening experience like no other. That is why they remain a sought-after piece of equipment for every music professional and audiophile alike.</p><p>The <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0765KJ5CB?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-X Over Ear Open Back Headphone with New Suspension Headband Creator Package – no Travel case</a></span> is one such pair of superior quality headphones that stay true to the promises they make.</p><p>It is important to note that while the Creator Package doesn’t come with a travel case or balanced cable, it still has the same pair of <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0765KJ5CB?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-X</a></span> headphones that are offered in the retail package. But this works to the advantage of those buyers who are looking for an affordable deal. It allows them to enjoy a discounted price for the same high-quality <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0765KJ5CB?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-X</a></span> headphones that come with the retail package, just without a travel case and balanced cable (which you can purchase separately).</p><p>Sporting what it calls a “crystal clear” midrange, the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0765KJ5CB?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-X</a></span> comes equipped with ultra-thin diaphragms, double-sided magnetic arrays, and the company’s signature Fazor Elements. All of these features come packed within a modern design structure which is made out of memory foam earpads, premium leather, and an ergonomic design with suspension headband.</p><p>When it comes to sound quality, it’s hard to surpass the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0765KJ5CB?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-X</a></span>. The ultra-thin yet large 106mm diaphragms do what they claim to do, and deliver a sound that is certainly true to life. Those who have used the headphones sing praises of the quality produced by the headphones, especially when it comes to the midrange. According to users, the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0765KJ5CB?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-X</a></span> provides exemplary sound regardless of the acoustics or the room it is being used in, which makes it all the more perfect for creators and listeners alike.</p><p>The <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0765KJ5CB?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-X</a></span>’s double-sided magnetic arrays prevent distortion and ensure the delivery of sound with realistic notes. It has been noted that this feature translates into providing a neutral, yet ultra-accurate sound, which brings out even the tiniest details of a recording to the forefront. This helps creators convert their sounds with a certain amount of confidence, while it provides listeners with an experience that remains unmatched by many other headphones.</p><p>Audeze’s signature Fazor Elements are there to serve their own purpose. With double-sided magnetic arrays, these elements work to prevent resonance to a very impressive margin. As a result, the waveform delivered through the headphones shines through in terms of lifelike sound. This has been noted by users firsthand, who vouch for the headphones’ soundstage, bass, and realistic rendition, no matter what kind of recording they listen to.</p><p>This clarity in sound quality, near-zero distortion, and accurate waveform all come together to make the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0765KJ5CB?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-X</a></span> ideal for sound engineers, producers, and audiophiles alike. Whether someone wants to produce their own tunes for the world to listen to, or if they simply want to enjoy recordings developed by their favorite artists, the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0765KJ5CB?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-X</a></span> could prove to be the best fit for the job.</p><p>Apart from its superior sound quality, the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0765KJ5CB?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-X</a></span> is also lauded for its built. Users note that the quality of the headphones’ structure is as good as the sound that it produces. This build quality is possible due to the way Audeze produces these headphones. Each pair of the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0765KJ5CB?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-X</a></span> is handcrafted in Audeze’s California facility, which allows the company to ensure optimal build quality using premium materials.</p><p>This attention to developing the headphones is translated very well in the comfort that they provide to the wearer. The memory foam, premium leather, and suspension headband along with the ergonomic structure provide a very comfortable fit to the wearer, even if they use the headphones for hours at a time. Users have noted that the headphones are comfortable to wear, even if they are “built like a tank.”</p><p>With that being said, the lack of a travel case is irksome to a few users, who say that it has affected the lifespan of their headphones.</p><p>But these complaints remain limited, whereas most users swear by the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0765KJ5CB?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-X Over Ear Open Back Headphone with New Suspension Headband Creator Package – no Travel case</a></span>’s quality and durability. According to them, the headphones are as perfect for sound mastering and mixing as they are for simply enjoying your favorite tunes.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>With exceptional sound quality, comfortable fit, and stylish yet durable build, the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0765KJ5CB?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-X Over Ear Open Back Headphone with New Suspension Headband Creator Package – no Travel case</a></span> remains a great fit for those music creators and listeners who do not see the lack of a travel case as an issue for portability or equipment safety.</p><p>As long as they are using the headphones carefully, they can enjoy the same sound quality and product benefits as the retail package, except for the travel case.
