This model is a foil-type shaver, providing close shaves and features an extra cutting element, coming out to a total of 4 foil shaving elements. These 4 shaving components are flexible, making sure you get a comfortable touch and a smooth shave. Due to their flexibility, they can mould to any angle and face shape while shaving. The <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F7XYMNN?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Braun Series 9 Men’s Electric Foil Shaver</a></span> also comes with a pivoting head that moves in no less than 10 directions. This means no more struggling with trouble spots and facial cuts in the mornings while you’re in a hurry to get ready. Now, it is true that sometimes you need a steady, stable head and not a rotating one to deliver that optimal shave. <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F7XYMNN?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Braun Series 9 Men’s Electric Foil Shaver</a></span> also incorporates a lock feature for the head in order to keep it in one place, in an angle you think fits. The motor the 9296cc model is equipped with uses Synchronized technology to create “40,000 cross-cutting actions per minute”. Compare this to the previous Series 7 models, which only provided 10,000 cuts per minute. This performance level ensures you get super-fast shaving in no time. As a bonus, users report minimal sound noise while using the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F7XYMNN?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Braun Series 9 Men’s Electric Foil Shaver</a></span> electric shaver. However, the biggest touted feature of this electric razor is its wet/dry shave technology. You can either use this for fast, dry shaving or you can use gel, soap, water, or shaving foam. You can even use this in the shower, as the shaver is 100% waterproof. The body is made with both premium plastic and metal. The handle where you grab the shaver is made out of rubber, which makes it easier to not have it slip out of your hands while you’re using it in the shower, for example.</p><p>Perhaps the best feature of this shaver is the base that it comes with. This is the only electric razor that is equipped with lubricant for the blades and alcohol-based cleaning fluid as well as serving as the charging station. The base automatically takes care of cleaning, charging, lubricating and drying of the shaver for your next use. The shaver comes with Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries. Buyers report their shaver lasts 50 minutes on average when used cordless after being charged for an hour. A full hour is what it takes for a full cycle of recharge time. There is also the option of quick charging, giving you a 5-minute charging option for when you need it urgently but are short on time. Amazon reviewers say this feature is good enough for a full quick shave. An LED display is present on the shaver, showing battery remaining, indication of recharge, a travel lock feature, cleaning indication (eco, normal or deep clean) and so on. A slide-up trimmer has been integrated into this model for those precise shaving of sideburns or moustaches. The travel lock feature is for when you press the power button for 3 seconds in case of travel, preventing the head from automatically turning on. Lastly, this purchase comes with a travel case for your needs. A multi-volt charging adapter ensures you don’t need to worry about fitting into electrical outlets and such.</p><p>If we talk about how the performance fared with buyers, customers loved that the dry shave option gave as good a shave as a wet one, with no skin irritations. The shaver is reported to give a fine, close-cut without leaving your face looking red, with most users saying they ended up ditching razor blades and rotary shavers for life after this purchase. One user described it as “the Rolls Royce of razors, the ultimate electric shaver”. The cleaning system is unanimously agreed to not be a marketing gimmick but work as intended, a quick wash underwater and you’re good to go. Manual cleaning is simple, popping off the foil head and brushing away excess hair. It is further described as not feeling like cheap plastic and feels the right amount of heavy in the hand. It even works out for people who are not fond of shaving or find themselves chronically short on time in the mornings, as many customers echo the sentiment that the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F7XYMNN?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Braun Series 9 Men’s Electric Foil Shaver with Wet &amp; Dry Integrated Precision Trimmer &amp; Rechargeable and Cordless Razor</a></span> does the job quickly and efficiently.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Negative reviews were few and far between, still gaining an average rating of 3/5 stars.
