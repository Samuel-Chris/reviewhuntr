    <p>If you have a busy schedule like me, then you might relate to the things you miss out on daily. You don’t have time to Netflix and chill. You can’t find time to schedule a spa appointment for a little R&amp;R. You don’t even have spare time to give yourself a pep talk. Thankfully, the need for recreation, relaxation, and motivation is met by good music. Those who have a jam-packed calendar would agree sometimes all you must do is play some music and relax. Lose your worries and zone out- or in - for a specific timeframe. But given that you can’t blast your favorite tracks through your commute, at the gym, and work or class, even listening to music could be a difficult task. You’ll need the right equipment.</p>

<p>That is where headphones come in. Many people turn to these nifty devices to make sure that they have great music getting them through different parts of their day – all without disturbing anyone. For such professionals and students, having headphones that fulfill the need for privacy without compromising on quality is of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/nuraphone-Bluetooth-Headphones-Personalized-Cancellation/dp/B076X4KH11/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;qid=1565733161&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-7&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mrpowerscript-20&amp;linkId=7aef8cbdeb3b4e885180ce5ce611884a&amp;language=en_US"><strong><em>Nuraphone Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Earbuds</em></strong></a> promise to fulfill that requirement – with a little twist of their own. Even at sporting an overhead design, they have earbuds fitted into the place where a traditional headphone’s speakers are supposed to be.</p>

<iframe style="width:120px;height:240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;source=ss&amp;ref=as_ss_li_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=mrpowerscript-20&amp;language=en_US&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&amp;placement=B076X4KH11&amp;asins=B076X4KH11&amp;linkId=c6d828b550b58eb27003278a87b7afb7&amp;show_border=true&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=true"></iframe>

<p>The result? A promise of superior quality active noise cancellation (ANC), personalized sound delivery to cater to your hearing needs, a whopping 20-hour of battery time, and a 12-month limited warranty. Seeing the price tag that the headphones carry, I decided to look into them to save fellow audiophiles the trouble of finding out whether these claims are valid or not.</p>

<p>For starters, I noted that the one thing customers have praised the most about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/nuraphone-Bluetooth-Headphones-Personalized-Cancellation/dp/B076X4KH11/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;qid=1565733161&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-7&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mrpowerscript-20&amp;linkId=7aef8cbdeb3b4e885180ce5ce611884a&amp;language=en_US"><strong><em>Nuraphone Wireless Headphones</em></strong></a> is their sound quality. Now, that is to be attributed to two things. First, it’s the very structure of the headphones, which uses earbuds instead of overhead speakers. Second, it’s the adaptive sound feature that seems to amaze most of its users.</p>

<p>While the effectiveness of the design of the earbuds is self-explanatory, it is vital to understand how it works. As noted by most users, the earbuds make sure that the headphones stay in place and delivers consistent quality by being in a fixed position. They also prevent any room for outside noise while offering clear high and low-frequency sounds. This feature makes them ideal for those students or professionals who want consistency in sound quality even as they make their way from one place to the other.</p>

<p>Even more than the innovative design, it’s the adaptive sound feature that sets <a href="https://www.amazon.com/nuraphone-Bluetooth-Headphones-Personalized-Cancellation/dp/B076X4KH11/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;qid=1565733161&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-7&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mrpowerscript-20&amp;linkId=7aef8cbdeb3b4e885180ce5ce611884a&amp;language=en_US"><strong><em>Nuraphone Wireless Headphones</em></strong></a> apart from its counterparts. While other headphones try to deliver the same sound to every person, the <em>nuraphone headphones</em> come with a built-in customization feature and a native app by the name of NURA. The headphones determine how to deliver sound to each listener according to how they respond to different sound frequencies. As a result, each user of these headphones can get the sound delivery adjusted to the way their ears perceive different sound frequencies.</p>

<p>Now, this feature is similar to some headphone adjustment apps available in the market. The EQ in iPhone popularly adjusts the equalizer, while Samsung’s Music app provides adaptive sound similar to nuraphone’s app. But given that the ability to make these changes in nuraphone comes directly from the manufacturer, it gives an edge to the headphones’ hardware and functionality.</p>

<p>As noted by users of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/nuraphone-Bluetooth-Headphones-Personalized-Cancellation/dp/B076X4KH11/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;qid=1565733161&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-7&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mrpowerscript-20&amp;linkId=7aef8cbdeb3b4e885180ce5ce611884a&amp;language=en_US"><strong><em>Nuraphone Wireless Headphones</em></strong></a>, it provides listeners with a customized sound quality unparalleled by most headphones.</p>

<p>The active noise cancellation (ANC) feature means that the mobility shouldn’t affect the sound quality. The ANC is expected to block out external noise by adding noise-canceling frequencies actively. For example, it blocks out the incessant chatter of your coworkers or classmates jabbering endlessly about something that doesn’t relate to you, as well as keeping out the sounds of traffic, the constant ringing of office phones, or the clangs and beeps of printers and keyboards around you. As noted by users, this feature also works as intended.</p>

<p>Users comment that the 20-hour battery time also works as expected. As such, whether you have a busy day full of being in front of your computer at work or putting together multiple assignments for school, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/nuraphone-Bluetooth-Headphones-Personalized-Cancellation/dp/B076X4KH11/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;qid=1565733161&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-7&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mrpowerscript-20&amp;linkId=7aef8cbdeb3b4e885180ce5ce611884a&amp;language=en_US"><strong><em>Nuraphone Wireless Headphones</em></strong></a> would last you more than the full day against a single charge.</p>

<p>The headphones weigh a mere 11.7 ounces, which makes them quite lightweight despite their traditional design. It has been noted that users who wear them throughout the day feel great.</p>

<p>But that is where opinions start to differ. Those who are not used to earbuds have complained that the design is not very comfortable. Whereas, those who got acclimated with the feeling of wearing earbuds say that they are very much at ease with wearing them all day.</p>

<p>Another slight disadvantage mentioned by users is that the headphones don’t connect to multiple devices at once. While the headphones have Bluetooth, they don’t have a multipoint connection. But this doesn’t seem to bother most users.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall, the  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/nuraphone-Bluetooth-Headphones-Personalized-Cancellation/dp/B076X4KH11/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=high+end+headphones&amp;qid=1565733161&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-7&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mrpowerscript-20&amp;linkId=7aef8cbdeb3b4e885180ce5ce611884a&amp;language=en_US"><strong><em>Nuraphone Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Earbuds</em></strong></a> seem to be an excellent choice for those who are looking for innovative design, excellent sound quality, and fantastic battery life.</p>

<p>With that, it is essential to keep in mind that wearing earbuds all day might be stressful for you if you are not used to it. You might need to give the headphones a few hours before you get comfortable wearing them.</p>
