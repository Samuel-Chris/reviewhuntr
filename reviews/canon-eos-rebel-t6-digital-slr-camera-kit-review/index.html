      <p>Have you ever considered indulging in photography? Once a person has mastered the basics, it is something that pays off in the long run. You can capture memories beautifully and re-visit them over again. However, you may have found yourself overwhelmed with all the choices out there. These days, there are so many options for the average everyday user and it gets harder to decide what to pick. Once you decide to check out the options, you might find your enthusiasm waning due to confusion about what to buy. I thought I’d make it easier for you by reviewing one of the most beginner-friendly cameras out there, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CO2JPYS/ref=dp_cr_wdg_tit_nw_mr&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Canon EOS Rebel T6</em></strong></a>.</p>

<p>The Rebel T6 has a plastic body and is one of the more lightweight models available, with a weight of no more than 3lbs. According to Amazon reviews, customers were surprised to find out how small in size the <em>T6</em> is, with it being described as “one of the smallest you can buy among DSLRs”. This is positive feedback for people who would not want to lug around a heavy camera around their neck or shoulder for trips to the mountains or the beach. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CO2JPYS/ref=dp_cr_wdg_tit_nw_mr&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Canon EOS Rebel T6</em></strong></a>, unlike its predecessor <em>T5</em>, comes with WiFi connectivity and a Digic 4+ processor, a step up from the basic Digic 4 processor and lack of WiFi connectivity. There are all the basic beginner modes available, like landscape, portrait and sports. For people looking to have more creative control, there are manual settings you can fiddle with, like aperture and shutter. The T6 is on the cheaper side of the DSLR range, costing around $550. The camera has been described by Amazon buyers as “very user friendly” and the added extra of WiFi connectivity is great for the people who want to upload their pictures to social media on the go. Hence, as an everyday camera, it is a good option to consider. For events and trips, automatic mode is reported to be good enough to do the job. If you plan on practising, there is a wide range of manual settings and modes provided. In the back, there is an LCD screen which has been described by buyers as having a better resolution than the previous model. For newbies, there is an added feature to help out in manual mode. When one wants to fiddle with the DSLR in manual mode, a brief description will show up on screen for guidance and information. This helpful feature can also be turned off in case you have been watching too many Youtube tutorials. This aspect of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CO2JPYS/ref=dp_cr_wdg_tit_nw_mr&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Canon EOS Rebel T6</em></strong></a> has been well appreciated among Amazon reviewers. The camera is part of a kit which also includes 2 basic entry-level lenses for a variety of photographic needs. If you own any existing lenses, buyers have found that majority of lenses are compatible with this camera. You will need to buy your own SD card for storage of pictures.</p>

<p>If we talk about some of the cons, the lack of touch-screen on the LCD panel on the back of the camera left some buyers frustrated. Another problem customers found off-putting was the fact that the LCD screen is fixed and cannot be flipped back. For photographers who are not entirely new to the DSLR scene, they will be disappointed to know that the ISO feature is automatic and you cannot change it even in manual mode. If you change other manual settings, the camera will set its own ISO. Some users shared that the camera’s shutter speed was a bit slower than average, taking up to 5 seconds to capture a photo. Others were disappointed to find that the camera did not perform up to par at capturing high-speed events, even in sports mode. One of the most shared sentiment about this camera, as reported by Amazon buyers, was that it was not as excellent in the video department, compared to photograph only. Issues with autofocus was a major complaint. The camera frequently beeped which meant it could not focus adequately on the subject and therefore, would not capture. If you want a camera for vlogging, this is not a good option for you as there is no jack for an external microphone. An in-depth user manual is also not provided in the box, and users have had to go searching online for instructions. Other major negative setbacks reported among users is that the camera’s WiFi will not work if the cable is attached to the computer. Apart from that, it was reported by some customers that WiFi will connect to users’ smartphones, but not laptops or computers. Make of that what you will.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overwhelmingly, users were quite pleased with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CO2JPYS/ref=dp_cr_wdg_tit_nw_mr&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Canon EOS Rebel T6</em></strong></a> regarding its functionality and price tag. For beginners, this is a highly recommended DSLR that does not require one to shell out big bucks. It is viewed as a very good choice for someone who wants to dabble in the field of photography as a hobby. It is also a good piece of equipment to learn the basics on. The Canon T6 won’t burn a hole in your pocket, is simple to use and easy to learn, and takes great photos as shared by Amazon buyers. Overall, it is viewed as great value for your money, user-friendly and a nice entry level option.</p>
