I use it every day. Whether it’s classic bands or modern pop legends, hearing their artistic expressions and identifying each of their musical notes enhances that experience for me. Judging by audiophiles, I interact with every day; I am not the only one who does that either.</p><p>Through the years of listening to various artists on multiple devices, I have also found that great equipment can make a significant difference. This fact holds whether you are rocking out to metal bands, enjoying classical symphonies, or appreciating incomparable sopranos. Your ordinary equipment will not match the quality that high-resolution audio brings out in a song.</p><p>The <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O12MH1S?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-3 Over Ear Headphones Fazor Elements</a></span> is one such piece of equipment that elevates your listening experience to unmatched heights. With planar magnetic technology that brings out lifelike sound quality, in addition to engaging midrange with powerful bass, and handcrafted design with wooden accents, this pair of headphones remains a powerhouse for anyone who truly loves their tunes.</p><p>The headphones come at a high price tag. But even with the substantial investment, many users not they are “worth it.” Mostly, it is due to their lifelike sound quality, made possible by the thinner-than-hair diaphragms, double-sided magnet arrays, and Audeze’s patented Fazor Elements.</p><p>The <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O12MH1S?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-3</a></span> was designed with state of the art technology, where everything from the housing to the earpad comes together to provide a deep soundstage. The structure between the ear pad and housing consists of layers of ultra thin-film diaphragm, neodymium magnets, and Fazor Elements.</p><p>While the diaphragms work for faster response time and improved imaging in the audio, the double-sided magnets ensure to prevent distortion almost wholly. At the same time, the Fazor Elements work as a guiding force for soundwaves to deliver optimal waveform.</p><p>With these technical elements, the result comes in the form of high-resolution sound. As noted by users, this claim isn’t a marketing gimmick. The headphones do provide astonishingly clear, the high-resolution sound that gives other high-quality headphones a run for their money.</p><p>Some users have compared their new <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O12MH1S?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-3 Over Ear Headphones Fazor Elements</a></span> to the other high-end headphones that they have owned in the past. According to them, the LCD-3 provides great value for money and surpasses almost all other headphones in its pricing tier. Its superior sound quality, once again, is noted by users during this comparison.</p><p>Since the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O12MH1S?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-3</a></span> are made for audiophiles, they come with a promise of long-lasting performance. With an industrial design that includes carefully made wooden rings, leather ear pads, and handcrafted structures, the headphones strike the perfect balance between aesthetics and durability. Users note that the structure of the headphones is unique, while also projecting the air of being healthy and sturdy.</p><p>The headphones also come in a military-style, rugged travel case that is meant to keep the equipment safe during travels or when not in use. As noted by users, it is an added advantage to ordering these high quality yet expensive headphones.</p><p>Each of the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O12MH1S?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-3</a></span> pair of headphones is meticulously handcrafted in the company’s California facility. This design allows Audeze to ensure high quality, no matter how much time it takes to develop each pair of headphones. This specific quality is also a feature singled out by users. They are impressed by the high-end structure of the headphones and attribute it to the price.</p><p>With that, some audiophiles have had issues with the comfort level of the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O12MH1S?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-3</a></span>. To them, the headphones are not very easy to wear for prolonged listening sessions. In particular, they single out the design of the headband, which supposedly prevents them from wearing these headphones for more than a few hours at a time. Contrarily, some users say that they have not found any problems with wearing these headphones for a longer duration.</p><p>Another critique comes in the form of the cost itself. Some users say that the company’s comparatively less-expensive LCD-2 model provides more value for money. But even then, they laud the sound quality that the LCD-3 had to offer to them.</p><p>What one needs to note here is that the cost of the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O12MH1S?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-3</a></span> is not the total amount of money you would be spending at the listening experience associated with the headphones. For optimal quality and the listening experience of a lifetime, you would need to pair the headphones with a high-quality amplifier.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>The <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O12MH1S?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-3 Over Ear Headphones Fazor Elements</a></span> remains a piece of listening equipment unmatched by almost any other headphones when it comes to sound quality. With that, the steep price tag and the questioning level of comfort might require you to reconsider your purchase decision.</p><p>If you optimize for the best and only wear your headphones for a few hours a day, then the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O12MH1S?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Audeze LCD-3</a></span> may prove to be an excellent investment for you.</p><div class="page-footer"><div class="page-share"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="page-tag"><a href="https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews#Headphones" class="tag"># Headphones</a></div></div><div> ReviewHuntr is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to amazon.com.</div></div></div> </article></div></div><script>!function(e,t,a,n,c,s,o){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,s=t.createElement(a),o=t.getElementsByTagName(a)[0],s.async=1,s.src=n,o.parentNode.insertBefore(s,o)}(window,document,"script","https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-121890486-4","auto"),ga("send","pageview")</script><script type="application/ld+json">
