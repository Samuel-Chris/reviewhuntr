Row machines are a great option for toning up as they work almost all parts of the body in minimal time. <em>Concept2</em> is a name that dominates the row machine market, known as a brand that is built to last and a favourite in gyms and CrossFit Boxes. The <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NH9WEUA?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Concept2 Model D Indoor Rowing Machine</a></span> is considered to be one of the best currently available. This row machine boasts quality and reliability. Let’s start with some facts. The <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NH9WEUA?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Concept2 Rowing Machine</a></span> is a rower that uses air-resistance instead of magnetic resistance, leading to a smoother row experience and is more similar to rowing in actual water. It has the ability to adjust its output, meaning if you row faster, it will give more resistance. This variable makes this row machine a great choice for HIIT workouts. You do not have to stop and change levels of resistance or other settings. The build of the machine is reported to last years even with regular usage. Most at-home gym users opt for a less stellar row machine and then are disappointed in the lack of value for money. If you’ve ever used a row machine in the gym, chances are that it was a <em>Concept2</em>. The seat is reported as comfortable to sit on even for extended amounts of time. It is also adjustable, meaning it “slides” to give the sensation of rowing a boat. The LCD screen mounted in the front, called a Performance Monitor, will turn on automatically once you start to row, and turns off after a couple minutes of inactivity. It has all the typical features like calorie data, number of strokes per minute, amount of distance rowed, how long you’ve been rowing, and so on. A new functionality of the monitor is a “race boat” game where you are in competition with a boat on screen. You have the option to compete against yourself from a previous session as well, or online against other <em>Concept2</em> users. These features are an upgrade from the old Performance Monitor 4, the current one uses PM5. The PM5 ensures you stay on track with your fitness goals and keeps you on your toes. The PM5 has the ability to connect to compatible RowPro software, a benefit only available with <em>Concept2</em>. You can also connect via USB cable to your computer in order to download your workout data, or even project your workouts on the TV via the RowPro software. Out of all the raves about this machine, buyers enjoy the engaging programming of the PM5 the most.</p><p>The <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NH9WEUA?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Concept2 Rowing Machine</a></span> comes in 2 colors, silver and black. The flywheel design makes sure there is minimal noise. The frame is designed to be separated in 2 blocks for transport or storing away as well as easy setup, the flywheel and the seat frame. The machine has “damper settings” on the wheel to change the amount of air moving into the flywheel, which has an impact of the “feel” on rowing. This is not the same as, for example, changing levels on a treadmill. This is more comparable to changing gears on a bicycle. For people who have had a knee injury of any sort or suffer from arthritis, Amazon users tout this machine as the best buy you can get. First of all, the machine is reported as being the easiest to set up, with only 2 parts you need to put together with 8 screws and screwdriver included. Batteries are already given in the console, so all one needs to do is put it together and it is ready to go. The design of the machine is very low-impact on the knees. The damper settings mean one can work up to rowing with a variety of difficulty modes. Another plus point for people who cannot participate in traditional cardio due to joint pains would be happy to read that Amazon users report this machine has the effect of enhancing your flexibility. This low impact row machine stretches out all major muscles and is a great way to combat sedentary sitting which weakens the muscles over time.</p><p>For people who share a living space, the noise emitted from the row machine is minimal, according to people who have bought and tested it out. It has no rumble and the only sound it makes is the fan used for air resistance. One can watch TV on a normal volume easily. Once you have it set up, the ease of a workout and time spent is a very big advantage most people appreciate. For people who work full time and can barely find time to fit in chores, this is a great alternative to joining a gym. You don’t have to pack a gym bag, put shoes on, no transportation, just hop on and in 15 minutes you have had a smooth workout on a smoother machine. Tall people can rejoice, for this machine comes with long rails. The only reported con amongst Amazon buyers and reviewers is that some people may not find the seat all that comfortable, as it is hard in design and not cushy. Some people who are overweight may find they cannot fit in the seat. The only competitor with this is their own model, the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NH9WEUA?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Concept2 Rowing Machine</a></span>, with the only difference being that the seat sits much higher for people who suffer from mobility issues.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>All in all, buyers unanimously agree that with this row machine, you get what you paid for. Most people are inclined to save money where they can, but for something you’d be using on the regular, it is a much better option to shell out those extra bucks to gain quality stuff that doesn’t fall apart in a short time. The difference in subpar machines vs the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NH9WEUA?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Concept2 Rowing Machine</a></span> are reported to be huge and it pays off. If you buy something that is a perfect fit for you, you are inclined to use it more, and people are loving their <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NH9WEUA?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Concept2 Rowing Machine</a></span> row machine.</p><hr><div> ReviewHuntr is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to amazon.com.</div><div class="page-footer"><div class="page-share"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Concept2 Model D Indoor Rowing Machine - Review&url=https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/concept2-model-d-indoor-rowing-machine-review/" title="Share on Twitter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Twitter</a> <a href="https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/concept2-model-d-indoor-rowing-machine-review/" title="Share on Facebook" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Facebook</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/concept2-model-d-indoor-rowing-machine-review/" title="Share on Google+" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google+</a></div><div class="page-tag"><a href="https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews#Gym+Equipment" class="tag"># Gym Equipment</a><a href="https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews#Workout+Equipment" class="tag"># Workout Equipment</a></div></div></div></div> </article></div></div><script>!function(e,t,a,n,c,s,o){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,s=t.createElement(a),o=t.getElementsByTagName(a)[0],s.async=1,s.src=n,o.parentNode.insertBefore(s,o)}(window,document,"script","https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-121890486-4","auto"),ga("send","pageview")</script><script type="application/ld+json">
