Whether you are working in your private office or lounging in your living room, sounds can elevate the experience. If you enjoy music, then you might always need your favorite tunes for motivation, relaxation, or to enhance your overall ambiance.</p><p>While expensive headphones promise the delivery of high-quality audio, they can only go so far in terms of relaxation and flexibility. That is where wireless speakers come in and provide a level of comfort and ease that remains unmatched by other devices.</p><p>The <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Wireless Speakers</a></span> promises the same flexibility while also letting users enjoy high-quality audio. Sporting Bose’s waveguide technology with premium drivers, the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Speakers</a></span> claims to spread rich sound in even the largest rooms by connecting to devices such as Amazon Echo, or just about any smartphone for that matter.</p><p>To deliver high-quality sound with clarity and depth, the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Speakers</a></span> supports all popular audio formats, including AAC, Apple Lossless, MP3, and WMA. At the same time, it also comes with dependable wireless connectivity in terms of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</p><p>When the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Wireless Speakers</a></span> connects with any Amazon Echo device, it offers full support for Amazon Alexa. All that users have to do to listen to their music is ask Alexa to play it for them. But those who don’t have an Amazon Echo device can still depend on the speaker’s Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. The connectivity allows them to play their music manually through compatible devices. With it, the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Speakers</a></span> also comes with a built-in OLED display, and a separate remote with six presets, which makes it easier to manage playlists and skip through stations.</p><p>As such, one can see that regardless of Amazon Echo availability, the Bose SoundTouch 30 could easily play music from different platforms. Through wireless connectivity and its intuitive remote, the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Speakers</a></span> could play tunes from popular streaming services including but not limited to Spotify, SiriusXM, iTunes, and Pandora.</p><p>Users have noted that the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Speakers</a></span> is extremely easy to set up. It is so simple and to the point where it only takes a couple of minutes to connect it to a new device. Since the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Speakers</a></span> is built to work with other Bose SoundTouch family of speakers, it also connects with additional speakers seamlessly. This is possible due to its wireless network functionality, which connects to such devices through 802.11 b/g/n. Users note that this quality to grow the speaker collection as users see fit adds a ton of flexibility to the speaker’s utilization, while also delivering complete surround sound at the users’ terms.</p><p>The speaker’s sound quality gets praised by those who look for deep, rich, yet clear audio. It has been noted that the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Speakers</a></span> can deliver high volume sounds while still being able to retain the audio quality and clarity. This makes it a highly sought after device for audiophiles looking to fill their home or office with their favorite music. Some have gone as far as to term it as the best speaker that they have ever used.</p><p>Users also note that it is quite easy to adjust audio levels in the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Speakers</a></span>. Those who like a certain amount of bass in their audio could quickly get it by tweaking a few settings. Those who want more clarity could also make their required changes rapidly. Users note that overall, the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Speakers</a></span> delivers the desired quality of audio for any music enthusiast with just a few tweaks and changes.</p><p>While being used through Bluetooth devices, the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Speakers</a></span> supports a 30 feet range when connected. Users have noted that this provides the listener with quite some flexibility. It has also been noted that this makes the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Speakers</a></span> is a great addition for larger rooms, where the devices being connected are far apart. The remote control only adds to this flexibility and allows users to enjoy changing their music even when they are at a certain distance from the device.</p><p>Measured at the dimensions of 7.1 x 17.1 x 9.7 inches, users praise the overall size of the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Speakers</a></span>. Weighing 18.5lbs, the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Speakers</a></span> is a bit heavy to carry around. But given that it is powered through an electric cord and is meant to be used as a stationary speaker anyway, the weight does not diminish its value proposition for its users.</p><p>Users also praise the overall look of the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Speakers</a></span>. Made with high-quality materials and sporting a modern design, the device projects a sleek style. One that is appreciated by those who are fans of this aesthetic. The OLED only enhances the speaker’s look, and the design itself lets the audio shine through whenever music goes.</p><p>Bose claims that the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Speakers</a></span> is extremely easy to connect with other devices. But some users take issue with that promise. According to them, the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Speakers</a></span> is not very user-friendly when it comes to connecting with other Bose SoundTouch devices, and provides a delay in the audio. With that being said, they still agree that the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Speakers</a></span> works great as a standalone device. At the same time, other users state no such issues and seem to have no problems connecting their <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Speakers</a></span> with other Bose speakers.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011IKGT46?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch 30 Wireless Speakers</a></span> provides its users with a rich and vibrant sound quality that is desired by every audiophile.
