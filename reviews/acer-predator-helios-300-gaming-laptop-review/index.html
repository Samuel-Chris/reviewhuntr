Since their origins, they have allowed us to carry out significant processes capable of simplifying multiple tasks, and over time, these have even become a source of entertainment.</p><p>Thanks to the exponential technological advances of recent years, and the emergence of different technologies, desktop computers are no longer the only option the market offers.</p><p>Multiple professionals, students and day-to-day users have discovered how comfortable and efficient laptops can be, — in part because they can be transported from one place to another with ease moreover because they continue to improve by leaps and bounds —, to the point that some may even surpass several desktop models.</p><p>If you are one of the many users who enjoy the advantages that a laptop can provide, this is an article for you, especially if you want to know various details related to a computer somewhat “powerful”; that you could use to spend long days playing demanding video games without sacrificing any performance.</p><p>If you are a beginner and don’t know how specific components work, or how they can be superior to others, don’t worry, as I’ll, in detail, explain the elements that make the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CTHLX8C?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop</a></span> an excellent choice for you.</p><p>The <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CTHLX8C?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop</a></span> features a 15.6” FHD IPS screen with a refresh rate of 144Hz, an Intel i7-8750H processor, a GTX 1060 6GB GPU, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB NVMe SSD, and Aeroblade Metal Fans PH315-51-78NP.</p><p>All the above makes this model an excellent choice. According to different reviews, it can be considered a high-performance laptop with outstanding performance concerning its price range. Despite having unique components, its price is around $1200, which makes it relatively accessible.</p><h3 id="pros">Pros</h3><p>The powerful components in the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CTHLX8C?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop</a></span> is probably the laptops biggest draw. Let’s go through them.</p><p>When it comes to the screen, this model has a 15.6” FHD IPS screen that provides wide viewing angles and excellent color accuracy. The 144hz refresh rate ensures an incredibly smooth gameplay experience — although, to take full advantage of this functionality you’ll need to play at a high enough FPS which means that the performance could vary according to the game and the configurations applied to it.</p><p>The Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 might not be the latest and greatest (that title goes to the RTX 2080 Ti, which is more expensive than this entire laptop) but it’ll be more than enough for your gaming needs. No, you won’t be able to play the latest AAA titles with all settings maxed out in 4K and with 250 fps but, if you turn down the settings just a little you’ll be able to run them smoothly. As for competetive games like Overwatch, CS:GO, and Dota 2 you’ll have nothing to worry about, let the graphics shine and the frames be high.</p><p>The Intel i7-8750H will make sure you have all the processing power you’ll need. Whether you’re trying to render out a YouTube video, building a scene in Unity, or just editing a photo you’re laptop won’t slog. The 16 GB of DDR4 RAM will also help to make sure your experience is as fast and smooth as possible.</p><p>In terms of aesthetics, the laptop consists of plastic and metal parts and a non-mechanical keyboard - which, according to different buyers, is one of the best non-mechanical keyboards on the market - with different luminous gadgets that make it somewhat “unique”. Despite being a slightly heavy laptop — approximately 5.51 lbs — many users have defined it as a comfortable piece of equipment to carry and even state that it is relatively light compared to other gaming laptops.</p><h3 id="cons">Cons</h3><p>Despite the pros there are some cons that have been frequently mentioned by users.</p><p>The laptop has somewhat limited storage with it’s modest 256 GB. However, the laptop does support expandable storage.</p><p>The laptop has significant problems of overheating which will effect both the gaming experience and performance in general — as such, overheating brings with it a considerably decreased fps in demanding games.</p><p>Until now, multiple solutions have been proposed by different users, the most common being to purchase a cooling pad, make use of the cool boost function integrated in the laptop itself, or even undervolting the CPU to prevent it from overheating.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Despite all the above and the significant problem of overheating, the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CTHLX8C?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop</a></span> is a great laptop, and most users in their reviews have agreed that it has an excellent quality-price relationship that makes it an outstanding choice for those who want to get an incredible gaming laptop for a friendly sum of money concerning the quality of its components, because its small problems can be solved with a little extra investment that will not require a budget higher than $1300, while most of the laptop gaming in the market easily exceed that price.</p><hr><div> ReviewHuntr is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to amazon.com.</div><div class="page-footer"><div class="page-share"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop - Review&url=https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/acer-predator-helios-300-gaming-laptop-review/" title="Share on Twitter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Twitter</a> <a href="https://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/acer-predator-helios-300-gaming-laptop-review/" title="Share on Facebook" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Facebook</a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews/acer-predator-helios-300-gaming-laptop-review/" title="Share on Google+" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google+</a></div><div class="page-tag"><a href="https://reviewhuntr.com/reviews#Laptops" class="tag"># Laptops</a></div></div></div></div> </article></div></div><script>!function(e,t,a,n,c,s,o){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,s=t.createElement(a),o=t.getElementsByTagName(a)[0],s.async=1,s.src=n,o.parentNode.insertBefore(s,o)}(window,document,"script","https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-121890486-4","auto"),ga("send","pageview")</script><script type="application/ld+json">
