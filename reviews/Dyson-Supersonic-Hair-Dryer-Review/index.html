Dyson is a company that has brought many engineering innovations to the market, in time that spans 4 years of research and 600 prototypes before reaching the ideal finished product. Now, you’re probably wondering if it’s possible to have such remarkable innovations on a basic hair dryer. The majority of buyers seem to share the opinion that Dyson has managed to re-invent and innovate the basic hair dryer, but the question at hand is specifically about whether or not the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F6XZ6BS?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer</a></span> has changed the playing field. With a price tag of $399, this is one of the most expensive hair dryers available, and people want to know if it’s worth its value.</p><p>Before we get to the pros and cons, let’s talk about the design. The design is sleek and smooth, and uses a small and efficient V9 digital motor, which is the smallest the company has to offer. This enables Dyson to get rid of the bulk that is usually at the top rear of dryers, and shift the manpower into its handle. That’s right, the handle conceals the motor that runs the dryer and shifts the weight into a more proportionate and even distribution, as well as making it have an overall compact look and feel. Buyers everywhere collectively expressed their relief by not having to hold a heavy weight over their head for an extended period of time, as is standard with most hair dryers. This dryer comes equipped with sensors that regulate the temperature 20 times in a second and relays the data back to a microprocessor to ensure the level of heat remains constant. This microprocessor keeps airflow temperature smooth and stable, with the temperature being kept under 150 degrees, so no more burning hair smell and hair damage is kept at a minimal. You get 3 heat settings and 3 airflow power settings to pick from, present on the back of the dryer. Temperature settings can be found on the left, and fan speed on the right side. Power and cool mode air buttons are found to be positioned on the handle, easy to reach with a thumb. The effort of engineering the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F6XZ6BS?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer</a></span> utilized shines through when you find out the 3 nozzles (standard wide, narrower for precise styling, and a diffuser) attach to the dryer magnetically. On the edges of the nozzles, there are “lips” that keep the flow cool and ensure that hot air doesn’t blow through, making the changing of attachments quick, easy and effortless. While other companies offer technological advancements involving the pairing of a gadget with an app, the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F6XZ6BS?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer</a></span> really shows us how tech advancements can be made to better things in ways that were never considered to need improvement.</p><p>Now, onto the pros. Most users of the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F6XZ6BS?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer</a></span> believe it does not get as hot as other dryers. Thanks to that, they also report their hair being much smoother, and less prone to falling as often happens when using a professional blowout, rather than a burnt, frizzy look. This is because of the microprocessor regulating temperature process detailed above. If heat above 150 degrees Celsius is applied, it can end up damaging the hair badly, which is what happens with most traditional hair dryers. Most customers gleefully report that they didn’t need to style their hair after blow drying due to the effectiveness of the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F6XZ6BS?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer</a></span>. Buyers also report being able to hold normal conversations while the dryer is running. Moreover, this is where you see the engineering of the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F6XZ6BS?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer</a></span> in effect: by adding 2 extra blades in the fan present in the handle, the noise generated by the motor is at a frequency that is outside of the normal range of hearing. Pretty cool, don’t you think? The design of the dryer is compact, and straighter compared to traditional L-shaped dryers, which makes it easy to fit into smaller drawers and cupboards, and squeeze into hand carries if needed. Reviews also show that on average, it cut down hair drying time by half, even for people with thicker hair. That’s thanks to Dyson testing in their own lab and finding out that the speed with which the air is pushed out matters more than the amount of heat it took. Thus, the motor is around 8 times more powerful compared to competitors, and the heat is kept at a lower level to minimize the amount of unnecessary hair damage.</p><p>The cons may outweigh the pros for some people. Some Amazon buyers report their <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F6XZ6BS?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer</a></span> did not last a long time, at an average of 6 months. That’s a deal breaker for people who would otherwise be willing to shell out near $400 for a hair dryer, and it is also the biggest recurring complaint among customers. Even when the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F6XZ6BS?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer</a></span> worked perfectly, most people seem to agree that even with all the revamp, this dryer is a bit too expensive to justify buying it.</p><p>The verdict seems to be that the <span><a class="product-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F6XZ6BS?tag=reviewhuntr-20" target="_blank">Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer</a></span> falls into the “luxurious” category rather than an upgrade. The design and performance are new and improved, but let’s be honest, it’s still a hair dryer.
