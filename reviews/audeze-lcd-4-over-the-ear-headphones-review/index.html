      <p>The sound of music is one of the very few things in the world that could draw the favorable attention of anyone regardless of their age, gender, or social setting. Whether you are an entrepreneur or an entry-level professional, an ambitious student, or a hardworking artist, listening to some great music is never out of the question.</p>

<p>After all, the music is that one thing in the world that could very quickly make you feel a ton of emotions depending upon the genre. Only by choosing an artist or a type of music, would you feel relaxed, motivated, reflective, or soothed in an instant.</p>

<p>This notion is all the more profound when your music is delivered free of distortion, latency, and muffled sounds. That is why you must choose hardware that provides you with superior sound quality, impressive imaging, and crystal clear notes.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-4 Over Ear Headphones</em></strong></a> rise to the challenge with a promise to meet these requirements with ease. For the most part, these high-end headphones also succeed by an impressive margin.</p>

<p>For starters, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-4</em></strong></a> comes with one of a kind nano-scale diaphragm that is lighter than air. Yes, you read that right. The diaphragm is so thin and light that this level of excellence in diaphragm development is exclusive to Audeze. In real-world terms, it promises the most accurate bass response among any commercial headphones on the planet.</p>

<p>With that, the diaphragm also allows the headphones to provide better imaging during playtime. What’s even better is that these claims are strengthened by users’ reviews, who support Audeze’s superiority in sound delivery through the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>LCD-4</em></strong></a>.</p>

<p>The diaphragm’s abilities are further enhanced by the magnet array technology included in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20">LCD-4</a>. With Double Fluxor Magnet Arrays, the headphones provide exceptional magnetic flux to an astounding 1.5 Tesla. This concept translates into a fantastic performance by offering more excellent resolution and a massively improved transient response as compared to its counterparts. The quality that these features add to the sound delivery is heavily noted by those who use the headphones.</p>

<p>What further adds to the nano-scale diaphragm and the magnet arrays of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-4</em></strong></a> is its Fazor Elements. The technology, which has been patented by Audeze, is proficient in guiding soundwaves to provide a clearer and accurate waveform. Users note that this translates to the headphones projecting the overall sound quality.</p>

<p>Made with ebony wood and leather ear pads, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-4</em></strong></a> sport a sleek yet industrial design that makes the headphones a delight to behold. Each of the pair is meticulously handcrafted in Audeze’s California facility, with the proximity providing the company with full control over its manufacturing and quality assurance.</p>

<p>Users note that these features add up to make these headphones “possibly the best in the world.” This notion is essential to note.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>The moniker mentioned above comes from an audiophile who utilized the product and shared their two cents.</p>

<p>The sound produced by the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-4</em></strong></a> remains incomparable to other headphones. A U.S. Army veteran, who utilized the headphones while going through a hearing disability, was awestruck to hear the clarity of the notes through the headphones. This comment stands as a testament to the overall results that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-4</em></strong></a> can provide to its users.</p>

<p>With that, the headphones do come at a massively high price tag. To say that they are a significant investment would be an understatement. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-4</em></strong></a> is worth it if you value quality.</p>

<p>Along with this, the headphones also require a high-quality amplifier to work optimally. Ideally, it should be a combo of an amp and DAC.</p>

<p>Optimize for the full experience.</p>

<p>Users also find an issue with the headphones’ weight and the overall comfort that it provides to the user. Some users think that the headphones are too heavy to wear for longer sessions, while others say that they have gotten used to the feeling. But in both cases, users praise the quality.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-4</em></strong></a> comes with a cryogenically treated premium braided cable. With high quality, silver-plated OCC copper, enjoy uninterrupted sound that comes without any signal loss.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>If you love listening to high-quality music and luxury experiences, then getting the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-4</em></strong></a> is just right. But if budget is an issue, then looking at lower-end or less expensive models would be the way to go.</p>

<p>With that, if you already have an amp or DAC setup or would like to go the whole nine yards with your audio experience, then the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-4</em></strong></a> just might be a no brainer.</p>
