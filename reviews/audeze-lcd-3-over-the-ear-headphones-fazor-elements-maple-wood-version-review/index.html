      <p>Audiophiles know that nothing may surpass good music. I know this for a fact. Not only do I regularly interact with self-identified audiophiles, I can easily claim to be one myself. I love immersing myself in music. I’d never be able to work out of an office that banned headphones.</p>

<p>I may digress, but good music is to an audiophile what a good book is to a bookworm. If you find an artistic work that you like you can go back to it, again and again, to find new meaning in it.</p>

<p>By repeat listening sessions of their favorite music, audiophiles can identify notes and ranges that they weren’t able to discover before. Doing so brings about a feeling of accomplishment, exhilaration, and recreation. As such, it serves as a great way to unwind for music lovers.</p>

<p>But to feel this profoundly enjoyable experience, you need listening equipment that is capable of bringing the best out of your music and highlight everything on the recording.</p>

<p>That is the reason why high-end headphones remain extremely popular among the “music 1%” (those who truly believe in listening to music as a hobby). With specialized design, materials, and functions, these headphones could elevate your music experience, unlike other audio equipment.</p>

<p>When you think of these high-end headphones, the Audeze LCD line instantly comes to mind. With the best design, material, and function features, these headphones remain a class apart. One of the most popular models from the series, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-3 Over Ear Headphones with Fazor Elements</em></strong></a>, remains a prime example of excellence in audio equipment.</p>

<p>Apart from the company’s popular Fazor Elements, that claim to deliver soundwaves flawlessly, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-3</em></strong></a> headphones come with ultra-thin yet large diaphragms. These diaphragms promise the delivery of powerful bass, clear top-end, and targeted midrange. The headphones also boast of double-sided magnetic arrays which claim to make distortion a thing of the past. The planar magnetic technology, on the other hand, aims to deliver a natural and accurate sound that highlights every single note on a recording.</p>

<p>As noted by users, all of these features make for a pair of headphones that deliver consistently compelling, clear, and flawless sound during each listening experience. Anyone who has used the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-3</em></strong></a> cannot stop highlighting the astoundingly high quality of its sound — a factor that remains prevalent in all kinds of recordings and music.</p>

<p>Users also note that this level of sound quality and consistency is possible due to the way that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-3</em></strong></a> is made.</p>

<p>The headphones are handcrafted and promise superior building processes to complement their high-quality sound. Built using leather suspension headband and ear pads, sturdy steel frame, maple wood rings, and braided cable, the headphones give off the unmistakable air of luxury while also bringing in durability as one of their other prime characteristics.</p>

<p>Besides aesthetics and strength, this build also reflects on the overall sound quality that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-3</em></strong></a> users rave about. Each earpiece on the headphones comprises of multiple layers of high-quality material, which aims to provide a superior listening experience.</p>

<p>For starters, the housing itself is made out of carefully picked and polished maple wood and durable steel. It is joined by Audeze’s lighter-than-air diaphragm, neodymium magnets, and Fazor Elements, before being topped off by the leather earpad. Users note that this results in headphones that come with the qualities of clarity, accuracy, and exceptional waveform.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-3</em></strong></a> headphones line comes with different types of wood rings. As mentioned above, this particular edition uses maple as the choice of wood, which looks exceptional against the jet black color of the main structure as well as the silver accents on top of it.</p>

<p>It looks as wonderful as it sounds.</p>

<p>For those who want to keep these premium headphones safe between use or who want to carry them around to use at their convenience, the headphones come with a sturdily-built travel case. This aspect ensures that whether you are traveling by bus or taking a personal car, your headphones remain safe from any impact.</p>

<p>As noted by users, this focus on material and safety reflects very well on the headphones’ build quality. The headphones are highly durable and built with the notion to last their owners for years. Users note that the headphones’ structure conveys this idea very clearly. This aspect also means that the headphones are fabulous for those who don’t want to shell out premium pricing for replacement headphones every couple of years.</p>

<p>Weighing just 1.4lbs, the headphones remain quite light as compared to other high-end models. A few users complain about only being able to wear them for a couple of hours a day, but others mention that they are comfortable to wear for the most part.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-3</em></strong></a> headphones come with a 1-year warranty on cosmetic parts and accessories, as well as a 3-year warranty on drivers. The hardware warranty is subject to manufacturer deficits. But as noted by users, the Audeze LCD-3 remains free of hardware issues and comes with a high-quality finish.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-3 Over Ear Headphones with Fazor Elements and Maple Wood Rings</em></strong></a> are a fantastic addition to any audiophile’s music library.</p>

<p>The price tag might seem high, but its design and sound quality make them justify their cost quite quickly.</p>

<p>If you are in the market for a pair of headphones that are just as rich in sound quality as it is in its looks, then your search might end with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&amp;tag=reviewhuntr-20"><strong><em>Audeze LCD-3</em></strong></a>.</p>
