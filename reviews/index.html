      <p>If you have a busy schedule like me, then you might relate to the things you miss out on daily. You don’t have time to Netflix and chill. You can’t find time to schedule a spa appointment for a little R&amp;R. You don’t even have spare time to give yourself a pep talk. Thankfully, the need for recreation, relaxation, and motivation is met by good music. Those who have a jam-packed calendar would agree sometimes all you must do is play some music and relax. Lose your worries and zone out- or in - for a specific timeframe. But given that you can’t blast your favorite tracks through your commute, at the gym, and work or class, even listening to music could be a difficult task. You’ll need the right equipment.</p>

      <p>Whether you’re just taking your first steps into the music world, or you already own a keyboard but you’re considering upgrading to a better one… there are some things you might want to consider before purchasing a new digital piano. First, the size of the keyboard, or more precisely, the number of keys. This will determine the higher and lower notes you’ll be able to reach. If you’re a beginner, you might be tempted to buy a small one, thinking you won’t be reading notes way above or below the middle staff. However, you’ll soon find yourself somewhat limited if your keyboard has less than five full octaves.</p>
