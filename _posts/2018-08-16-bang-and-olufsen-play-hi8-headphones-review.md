Whether you endure a long commute, or if you simply want to appreciate good music while doing your tasks, having a great pair of headphones could prove to be the answer to your silent prayers.
 
Why wouldn't it be? Your headphones couldn't only keep you company through your train, bus or even a long cab ride, but can also make sure that you aren't disturbing anyone else with your music. Everybody wins.
 
Apart from being a savior for you and others over your commute, your headphones could also become that one gadget you can't live without at home or work. This is true for noise-canceling headphones, which block out the outside world, as well as the annoying, beeps and bloops of many phones, computers, and printers that make for a modern work or study environment.
 
A good pair of headphones is essential to someone's day to day comfort, especially if they enjoy electronic entertainment like most of us. I have been using my noise-canceling headphones in and out of work on a daily basis. Nothing beats listening to my favorite music at work or watching my favorite shows or movies at home in complete privacy.
 
A pair of headphones that promise this privacy, as well as excellent sound quality, is the [***Bang & Olufsen B&O Play H8i***](https://www.amazon.com/Bang-Olufsen-1645146-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B078HPHLPR/ref=sr_1_10&tag=reviewhuntr-20). Sporting a traditional headphone design with high quality, sleek materials, this pair of headphones is a looker. Available in three colors, the headphones uses premium leather, lambskin, and memory foam to promise a comfortable fit for your ears and head.
 
Apart from the looks, comfort, and durability, the [***B&O Beoplay H8i***](https://www.amazon.com/Bang-Olufsen-1645146-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B078HPHLPR/ref=sr_1_10&tag=reviewhuntr-20) promises to provide superior sound quality with active noise cancellation (ANC). It also offers complete microphone clarity for voice calls and carries a whopping 30 hours of battery time against a single charge.
 
[***B&O Beoplay H8i***](https://www.amazon.com/Bang-Olufsen-1645146-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B078HPHLPR/ref=sr_1_10&tag=reviewhuntr-20) has a proximity sensor that stops your music as soon as you take your headphones off of your head and resumes it when you put them back on. The Transparency Mode lets you swing in and out of your surroundings, while the *Bang & Olufsen* app lets you choose between different equalizer settings and allows you to turn ANC on and off.
 
The feature that is most lauded by the users of the [***B&O Beoplay H8i***](https://www.amazon.com/Bang-Olufsen-1645146-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B078HPHLPR/ref=sr_1_10&tag=reviewhuntr-20) headphones is undoubtedly the sound quality. As I discovered through user reviews, almost every user canâ€™t seem to get enough of their clarity and quality.
 
Another product feature that turns into a fantastic benefit for users of all types is the battery life. Users comment that the advertised battery time of up to 30 hours seems to reflect quite well in real-time use. Those who have a busy schedule don't have to worry about charging their headphones every single day. Depending upon the use case, a single charge could last for days.
 
The active noise cancellation (ANC) gets its fair share of praise as well. Since the headphones are built with comfortable material that covers the ears, the passive noise cancellation is already at work. But active noise cancellation takes it to another level, where users can completely tune out from their surroundings. Conversely, turn on the Transparency mode and listen to everyone else actively even while you have your headphones on.
 
Another thing that users have noticed is how comfortable it is to wear these headphones. Since they use a mix of premium materials, it is not a surprise. But it is still great to know that someone who likes listening to music all day or binge their favorite TV shows could count on maximum comfort.  
 
But not all is well with these headphones.

Some users don't like that it seems to be too pricey. At the same time, I noted that most of the other users seem to be quite content with the features that the [***B&O Beoplay H8i***](https://www.amazon.com/Bang-Olufsen-1645146-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B078HPHLPR/ref=sr_1_10&tag=reviewhuntr-20) offers to them in its price tag.

Another niche complaint comes in the form of build quality. While most users agree that the [***B&O Beoplay H8i***](https://www.amazon.com/Bang-Olufsen-1645146-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B078HPHLPR/ref=sr_1_10&tag=reviewhuntr-20) seems to be made out of comfortable and durable material, some comment that they have a problem with the build quality. But similar to the price issue, this also remains as something that was brought up by minimal people.
 
Apart from that, other features such as the voice quality over calls and proximity sensor all seem to be getting their fair share of praise. Since the pair of headphones only weighs 7.52 ounces, it is not bulky to wear either, which once again adds to its value proposition.
 
### Conclusion

Overall, the [***B&O Beoplay H8i***](https://www.amazon.com/Bang-Olufsen-1645146-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B078HPHLPR/ref=sr_1_10&tag=reviewhuntr-20) is an excellent pair of headphones. It is mainly a good fit if you don't mind wearing a traditional design and could get down with black, pink, and beige colors.
 
The sound quality and battery timing are undoubtedly the stars of this product. With that, it does come at a steep price for those who have never purchased premium headphones before.
 
But with the knowledge that the [***B&O Beoplay H8i***](https://www.amazon.com/Bang-Olufsen-1645146-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B078HPHLPR/ref=sr_1_10&tag=reviewhuntr-20) provides what it promises, you could go ahead with bringing it home as your music and visual entertainment companion.
