Drones are very cool. Drones like the {{ link }} can be even cooler. Both interesting and entertaining, these types of devices are becoming more important in an era where we expect convenience over everything.

  

From small startups to large corporations, some are using drones to deliver packages while others are using them for food delivery. But that’s not all, since drones are also used in the battlefield on a regular basis.

  

Simply put, these unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have so many uses besides entertainment that there are many companies who have established a base in this sector. That’s why, the drone industry is likely to keep growing over the next decade. Why won’t it? People ranging from adults to kids love their drones and use them for a broad range of reasons. For them, it will definitely be fun to use these products and learn more about their versatility as they advance further.

  

What’s even better is that drone technology will continue to evolve as each different component is improved over time. As more innovation and big investment brings more advanced drones to the market every few months, getting in early and understanding the basics might be worth your time as a drone enthusiast.

  

With this in mind, it’s essential that you get in on the drone trend and get a UAV of your own to fly around. It can help you get acclimated with the technology before it gets too late to do so, while also providing you with plenty of fun in the process. Since {{ link }} promises all that and more, let’s see what it has to offer to its users.

  

{{ link }}

First off, the {{ link }} comes with a remote controller as well as a standard Spark accessory kit. Users will also note that it has a 2-axis stabilized Gimbal Camera that boasts of the ability to take 12 MP still photos while also being able to shoot 1080p Full HD videos. This means that you can take standard quality pictures and videos, which are great for casual and aspiring photographers and videographers.

  

It is Easy to Fly

The {{ link }} comes with flight autonomy, GPS and vision position-based navigation, and a 3D obstacle detection system. But what does that even mean for the user? It’s simple. The drone can navigate its way easily through different routes with less chances of bumping into obstacles. This advanced technology adds to the drone’s capabilities and allows it to move about in a smarter fashion. It doesn’t rely on satellite signals but may be enhanced by them. This promises a smarter and easier way to fly your UAV whether you are taking pictures, videos, or simply posing for selfies.

  

It Comes With All Basic Accessories

The drone comes with three foldable pairs of propellers, which makes it easier to carry around for larger shoots. It also comes with its own Intelligent Spark battery, charger, and micro-USB cable. According to users, these accessories are standard to any drone and help make the {{ link }} be on par with its many counterparts.

  

It Has a Good Speed

In addition, users note that the drone can go up to at least 31 mph when used in sport mode. It can last for 16 minutes with each charge. According to users, the battery time can fluctuate a couple minutes under the 16 minutes range, but they are satisfied with what time they get out of a single charge anyway.

  

It Promises Value for Money

While the battery life is decent according to users, the drone does not come with a memory card. This means that you can get ready to spend an additional amount of money on a memory card before you can enjoy taking photos with your drone. But users seem content with this requirement as well, stating that the drone is already cheaper than what it used to be and is currently being offered as a bargain at its current price. For many, the drone promises value for money with its overall features, speed and agility.

  

Apart from getting positive reviews for its price and overall package, the {{ link }} also has a control range of up to 1.2 miles. Users find this to be a pretty good control range, since the {{ link }} is considered more of a starter drone than anything else by the UAV enthusiasts who have purchased it. According to users, the easy to fly drone presents a good starting point to learn what being a UAV pilot is all about.

  

The Dimensions are Pretty Neat

The {{ link }} weighs approximately 1.6 lbs and sports the dimensions of 10.2 x 8.5 x 6.6 inches. This makes the drone easier to fly for new pilots, while also giving it a certain edge over bulkier counterparts that come in the same price point. Users find the drone to be easy to carry around, which makes adventure photography more fun for them.

  

But Users Have Issues with the GPS Signal

With that being said, very few users of the {{ link }} seem to take issue with the drone’s GPS signal capabilities. Some of these users note that the GPS signal calibration is not very easy, while others mention that the GPS signal is often lost when the drone has not even reached its control range. This makes the drone difficult to fly for these users and causes issues with retrieval to home. At the same time, other users seem perfectly happy with the way they have flown the drone and how it has returned results that they expected out of it.

  

## Conclusion

Overall, the {{ link }} remains a good value for money for its users, especially if you are going to utilize it for home use in terms of some flying fun, or for taking casual pictures and videos. But if you are looking for a more professional drone with higher picture quality and flight time, then looking into another model might be the right choice for you.
