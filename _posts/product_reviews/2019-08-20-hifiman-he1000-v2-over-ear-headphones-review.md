Real music enthusiasts want quality. It is not just a want. They desire phenomenal quality. As I have noticed in my own experiences, this holds true regardless of the type of person. The audiophile may be a working professional or a student who happens to love music.
 
Given that no one could attend a live concert with exceptional sound quality every single day, the objective of a consistently astounding listening experience seems impossible to achieve. But as demonstrated by high-end headphones, it isn’t that difficult.
 
Regardless of the kind of music you like, a great pair of headphones could be the difference between drearily hearing a distorted song and thoroughly enjoying a crystal clear performance. By simply upgrading your listening equipment,  find new life in old songs. You may also discover fresh notes that you previously missed.

Why not unveil the best parts of new music right from the get-go?   
 
The [***HIFIMAN HE1000 V2 Headphones with Planar Magnetic Technology***](https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&tag=reviewhuntr-20) promises to check all of these boxes, and then some. They are pricey, alright. But the significant part about these headphones is that they undoubtedly fulfill their claims of delivering excellent sound quality.
 
Boasting the use of the world’s first-nanometer diaphragm, the [***HIFIMAN HE1000 V2***](https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&tag=reviewhuntr-20) also features an advanced asymmetrical magnetic circuit, a patented structure for natural soundstage, and manual craftsmanship for high-quality design. When combined, these features come together to offer sound quality that is natural and distortion-free. For those upgrading from lower-range headphones, it promises to turn their listening experience around for the better.
 
The nanometer diaphragm in [***HIFIMAN HE1000 V2***](https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&tag=reviewhuntr-20) is supposed to deliver faster response while keeping distortion at bay. As noted by those who have used these headphones, the thin diaphragm does its job impressively. The sound produced by these headphones delivers crisp, bright, and vibrant tunes at every session. No matter the genre of music, the headphones’ sound quality remains notably natural and reminiscent of a great live listening experience. This notion means that if you are one to enjoy music without the restriction of the genre, these headphones would be a perfect match for you.
 
The advanced asymmetrical magnetic circuit, which uses a double-sided design, works together with the nanometer diaphragm to elevate the distortion-free listening experience even further. The feature also translates into real-world use effectively and provides users with a midrange that is free of any reflections or deflections.

As noted by users, this is once again evident in the sound quality produced by the headphones. Whether you are a hardworking professional or an extremely busy student, a single listening session at the end of the day could certainly elevate your mood.
 
Some users have also noted that the midrange is one of those aspects where the [***HIFIMAN HE1000 V2***](https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&tag=reviewhuntr-20) shines at its best. From highlighting vocals to shaping instrumentals, and from delivering a natural sound to elevating different notes in a song, the headphones elevate the overall listening experience quite impressively.
 
But that’s not all, especially when it comes to sound quality. The patented structure, dubbed as “Window Shade” comes with an open back design that is as comfortable to wear as it is effective in enhancing the listening experience. The strategic design has given the headphones such a shape that they steer clear of any troublesome vibrations. The design also eliminates any distortions that are caused due to a headphones’ structure, which is quite noticeable in most commonly used equipment.
 
As a result, this structural Window Shade design claims to deliver spectacular imaging with exceptional clarity. Users have noted that the [***HIFIMAN HE1000 V2***](https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&tag=reviewhuntr-20) holds to this promise.
 
But even as everyone who has used the [***HIFIMAN HE1000 V2***](https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&tag=reviewhuntr-20) sings about its sound quality, most of the users mostly complain about the craftsmanship of these high-end headphones.
 
The headphone comes in a traditional design that comprises silver, gold, and black accents with a suspension headband. Even at being a conventional design, the style is modern and sleek. It is an excellent design in terms of aesthetics, and users don’t seem to have any complaints about the appearance. But they have a lot to say when it comes to the build and its quality.
 
The headphones claim to be handcrafted and checked for quality – something that is supposed to be demonstrated in each pair. But according to users, this is not the case. Some users take issue with unwanted scratches on the pairs that they have received, while others speak of detached or poorly attached padding materials that should not be visible in high end headphones.
 
The overall packaging and craftsmanship seem to be the only issue that is brought up with the [***HIFIMAN HE1000 V2***](https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&tag=reviewhuntr-20). But it seems like a big problem for those who are spending a large amount on this equipment for the love of music. With that, not all users seem to complain about build quality. Those who have received perfectly crafted pairs have not had any complaints about the headphones.
 
### Conclusion

Overall, the [***HIFIMAN HE1000 V2***](https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&tag=reviewhuntr-20) somewhat justifies its high price point through superior sound quality. But it doesn’t do complete justice to its cost due to its build issues.
 
With that, the build issues have not been prevalent for most users. If you are looking for headphones that deliver exceptional sound, then you could certainly go for the [***HIFIMAN HE1000 V2***](https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-HE1000-V2-Magnetic-Headphone/dp/B01I50644C/ref=sr_1_13&tag=reviewhuntr-20). Just make sure to contact the manufacturer for warranty and replacement information in case you might end up with a pair that has issues in its built.
