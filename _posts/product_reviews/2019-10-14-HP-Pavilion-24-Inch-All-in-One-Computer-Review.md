In this day and age where technology is more of a necessity than a luxury, having a desktop machine is highly crucial for any humble abode. Whether it is used as a communication tool, an entertainment center, or a research device, a computer could serve many purposes for each member of a typical household. A laptop can help connect one to a world of endless opportunities and provide significant value overall.

Since compact and modern options are now the norm in every technological device, desktop computers are no exception to the rule. Gone are the days where every household had to have a desktop rig. Now, those machines are only reserved for hardcore gaming or rendering purposes. An all-in-one computer where the engine is built into the screen is the new normal for home use.

The {{ link }} is one such compact desktop machine that’s built for the whole family. Sporting a 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5-9400T processor, 12 GB of RAM, 512 GB Solid State Drive (SSD), Intel UHD Graphics 630, and Windows 10 Home OS, the computer promises to fit the needs of everyone, whether they want to watch Netflix, browse the web, or make video calls all day.

 
The desktop all-in-one station has a 1080p Full HD 23.8” diagonal IPS touchscreen, which allows users to enjoy their content to optimal clarity seamlessly. The FHD capability gives users the power to consume high-quality content in the comfort of their home, while the 10-point touch-enabled screen gives them the ability to operate the computer through their fingertips. With it, the desktop also comes with Bang & Olufsen (B&O) audio for its dual speakers, which elevates the multimedia experience to the next level with high-quality audio delivery.

 
Since everything is settled under the screen in a compact yet powerful machine, the {{ link }} doesn’t have a separate desktop rig. Connectivity ports for USB 3.1, USB 3.1 Type-C, HDMI In, HDMI Out, and 3-in-1 media card reader are all available at the back of the screen - which remains ultra-slim despite its power. A port for microphone/headphone combo is also available next to them. The {{ sn-link }} also comes with a built-in FHD webcam, which allows users to make video calls right off the bat.

 
Apart from these physical connectivity options, the {{ sn-link }} also comes with wireless connectivity in terms of Bluetooth 4.2 and Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac. The SSD makes sure that users could copy and transfer data within seconds instead of minutes and ensures complete efficiency in running the computer for everyday applications.

The {{ sn-link }} also comes with built-in Intel UHD Graphics 630, which allows users to perform graphics-based tasks and play some of the most popular games with ease. If users need to upgrade the 12 GB RAM to meet their gaming needs, then they could opt for a 16 GB RAM option as well. For ultimate comfort, they could also go for wireless keyboard and mouse that connect through Bluetooth.

 
In terms of practical use, users have noted that the {{ link }} holds up to its claims of performance. With the six-core, 1.8 GHz Intel i5-9400T processor and 12 GB of RAM, users seem quite satisfied with performing their day to day work, study or entertainment-related activities on the computer.

Many users also note that the {{ sn-link }} seems to deliver in terms of the rich multimedia experience, which is due to its FHD support, B&O audio, and built-in graphics. With it, users have noted that the computer is quite elementary to set up once it arrives at their doorstep. Since there are minimal wires to be fixed especially when compared to a traditional desktop, the {{ sn-link }} gets settled on a desk within a few minutes. Users have noted that the computer itself walks them through the setup, and helps them initialize its first run.

 
From there, it has been noted that the computer fulfills every expectation that it advertises. Apart from fulfilling multimedia tasks, it does well on the communication front, and also seems to deliver on work-related tasks where users need to be using multiple applications during the course of their computer activity.

To top it all off, users seem to like the HP-powered tech support that comes with the {{ link }}. The {{ sn-link }} also comes with a 1-year limited warranty, which is there to help users if their home computer stops working all of a sudden or presents significant performance issues
 

The one thing that some users have pointed out as being a slight issue with the {{ sn-link }} is the limitation in terms of graphics. But that is understandable since the home computing machine is an all-in-one machine and not a gaming rig.
