Video games are one of the most popular ways to unwind after a long day of work, a stressful few hours at school, or after a particularly tough time of running chores. From expensive consoles to affordable apps, everyone plays their games on their terms, with some opting for exclusively single-player games and others going for options with multiplayer support.

But no matter what kind of games you play, you must be aware of a certain few brands that are synonymous with the very idea of gaming.

With various games from its library now being household names, the mere mention of Nintendo is sure to spark joy in anyone.

That’s why, when you can see that the {{ sn-link }} comes with a Neon Red and Neon Blue Joy-Con, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect.

It also could be used in its tabletop mode with each detachable Joy-Con acting as its separate controller for multiple players. With it, it could also be docked to connect with a TV and have two or more players join in on the fun. In this docked mode, each Joy-Con also acts as its separate controller, and you could buy additional Joy-Con in case you want your multiplayer experience to involve more than two people. This extended multiplayer support means that you can play your favorite titles with family and friends.



The {{ sn-link }} handheld device by itself sports a 6.2” screen.

The Joy-Con connectivity in multiplayer mode is wireless, which makes each Joy-Con a delight to play with according to users. The battery life for each Joy-Con is said to be around 20 hours of playtime, but some users mention that it seems to last longer.
