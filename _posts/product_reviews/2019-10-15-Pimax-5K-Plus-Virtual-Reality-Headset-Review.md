The world of digital entertainment is changing at a rapid pace. The once cutting edge 3D-gaming technology is quickly being replaced by virtual reality (VR), which lets users dive into gaming as they have never imagined before.

  

With completely realistic environments and an experience that is close to life, VR gaming is leaving other gaming modes behind. Those who enjoy gaming and hold unique machines in terms of gaming desktops or laptops are now turning to VR-powered devices to get the most out of their gaming experience.



The {{ link }} is built with these ideas in mind. The {{ sn-link }} has been developed to deliver a seamless VR experience to the wearer. As such, this allows them to immerse themselves in digital entertainment. It is available in a special offer by Amazon and comes at an affordable price. Remember that controllers and base stations could be purchased separately.


Sporting dual custom low persistence liquid crystal panels with a combined resolution of 5120x1440 pixels and a 200° diagonal field of view (FOV), the {{ link }} comes equipped with the means to deliver VR content in a unique and indulging way.

Further, the {{ sn-link }} uses premium quality materials, sturdy ergonomic build, and support for almost all Steam and Oculus Home VR content. It also supports VR controllers and technology by most other brands, such as other brand Steam controllers as well as the SteamVR Lighthouse 1.0 and 2.0 tracking technology
 
The {{ link }} is also created with those in mind who wear prescription glasses. The headset has enough room to fit most prescription glasses frames, while it also provides IPD adjustment through hardware and software modes. This adjustment aspect ensures that everyone has a picture-perfect vision for their VR content.

The {{ sn-link }} is compatible with most high-end gaming computers. Specifically, the minimum PC specifications are Nvidia GTX 1070 graphics card, with AMD equivalent accepted; 8 GB RAM; Windows 8 OS; Intel Core i5-4590 or AMD FX 8350; DP 1.4 video output; and 1 USB 2.0 port. The higher the user’s computer specifications are, the better it is in terms of the overall experience. For example, if you have a USB 3.0 port, then it is all the better to use it than strictly meet the minimum requirement of a USB 2.0 port.

The {{ link }} is on par with other similar, VR headsets in terms of its size. Its dimensions are 11.1 x 4.3 x 5.4 inches, with a total weight of 1lb. These dimensions make it small and lightweight enough to wear comfortably for those who plan to immerse themselves in VR content now and then.

 
The {{ sn-link }} comes in a single color choice, which is black with ambient blue light at the front. It is made with durable yet comfortable material that once again adds to the total wear time without taking its toll on the user. While the {{ sn-link }} does not come with any base stations, it does support external equipment in the form of HTC Vive Lighthouse 1.0 or 2.0 base stations, as well as the Valve Index Lighthouse base stations.

When it comes to actual use, the {{ link }} gets rave reviews from its users. Dubbed as the “next generation” of VR headsets by one user, the gadget is praised for its smooth content delivery that comes without any choppy video. Users have also noted that the {{ sn-link }} provides the widest FOV that they have experienced in any other headset, which makes it all the more appealing to those gamers who do not want to miss out on even a single pixel.

The superwide FOV is the crown jewel of the {{ link }}. As the feature that sets the {{ sn-link }} apart from its competition, the FOV gets the headset its most positive reviews. This is possible due to the dual custom low persistence liquid crystal panels, and their combined resolution of 5120x1440 pixels, which provide ample support to the truly exceptional 200° diagonal FOV.



Users have noted that the FOV makes sure that they are not missing out on anything during their gaming experience. The way that the wide FOV almost eliminates the screen door effect (SDE) and provides a high-quality VR experience is something that practically all users highlight about the headset.


Users also praise the VR content support. Since the {{ link }} supports over 95 percent of the content on Steam VR and Oculus Home, users have a plethora of options to choose from, including famous titles such as Fallout 4 VR and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR. This is another quality that makes {{ link }} a good option for avid gamers.

  

With that being said, users have complained about the {{ sn-link }} needing a very high-end machine to pull off its operations optimally. Some users also mention that the plastic strap attached to the headset seems cheap and out of line with the rest of the structure. But these complaints remain minimal, and users seem to like what they see in terms of the overall performance of the headset.

  
## Conclusion

The {{ link }} makes for a great VR device. While this offer comes with just the headset, it is considerably affordable and better in performance as compared to other devices in its class.

 
All in all, the superwide FOV, high-quality imaging, and an astounding content library make the headset an excellent choice for any gaming enthusiast.
