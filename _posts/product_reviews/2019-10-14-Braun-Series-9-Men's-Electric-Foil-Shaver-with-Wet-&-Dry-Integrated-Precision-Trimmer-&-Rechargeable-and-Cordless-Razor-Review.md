Except for {{ sn-link }}. A household staple name {{ sn-link }} is well known across the globe for staying on top of their game. {{ sn-link }} latest, the Series 9 Shaver models are one of the best you can invest in. {{ sn-link }} history of using long and sometimes complicated descriptions of their technologies are always up to par. Did they succeed this time?

Lastly, this purchase comes with a travel case for your needs. A multi-volt charging adapter ensures you don't need to worry about fitting into electrical outlets and such.   

If we talk about how the performance fared with buyers, customers loved that the dry shave option gave as good a shave as a wet one, with no skin irritations. The shaver is reported to give a fine, close-cut without leaving your face looking red, with most users saying they ended up ditching razor blades and rotary shavers for life after this purchase.

## Conclusion

Negative reviews were few and far between, still gaining an average rating of 3/5 stars. These reviewers were more partial to the Series 7, or even Series 5, and did not click well with the {{ sn-link }} . Head size was reported to be a bit larger than average, making it difficult for some people to get a good, even shaving performance. Cleaning refills need to be brought regularly for the cleaning feature. The overwhelming consensus seems to be that with this device, even though the upfront cost seems to be high, you get what you paid for and is worth the price and investment.
