In today's fast paced world, it's no secret that most of us have no time to cook full meals from scratch, particularly if it requires intensive cooking times. College students, busy parents and the elderly are some people who are simply unable to give cooking the time it demands. When time is short and limited, some people even skip meals, which isn't good for you if you keep doing it consistently. To remedy this, an investment into an electric pressure cooker should be considered. These staple items that should be present in every household makes sure meals are quick and easy to prepare, especially for those people who are into eating clean, made from scratch food. Investing in a capable electric pressure cooker is a great time saver and you will get delicious meals in return. You can't go wrong with that!

The {{ link }} is one such cooker that caught my eye. So I'm on here gathering feedback and reviews for people who are considering investing in this amazing cookware. These days, you even get the option of having a "smart" pressure cooker that connects to WiFi, which is just crazy if you ask me. A solid electric pressure cooker that can do its job is what one needs, and you don't have to go broke trying to get one. 
The {{ sn-link}} is a programmable cooker with a stainless steel cooking pot that comes in with build-in presets to do your work for you. It has options available for a wide variety of meals, like rice, multigrain, porridge, stew or meat, poultry, veggies, seafood and so on. If you prefer more versatility in your cooking, this cooker comes with a manual mode that lets you decide between three different pressure settings. You can choose between low, medium and high. Buyers shared on amazon that this feature allows one to specify and customize the cooking experience. 
The biggest selling point of this pressure cooker is its versatility. It has a one of a kind design that gives you the functions of 9 different appliances in one place. The tasks this machine can do range from traditional pressure cooking, rice pudding, porridge, to yogurt maker, to egg maker, with only a push of a button! You can use this device as as warmer, slow cooker, steamer, browner. This wide spectrum allows this pressure cooker to be a suitable option for students or people who have basic knowledge of cooking and are just starting off. The safety mechanisms are in place to keep you safe from the build-up of steam. There is an in-built pressure release button on the lid, which makes it easier, safer and quicker to release the pressure build-up. This product boasts an ETL stamp for matching industry standards of safety.     

Most Amazon reviewers are quick to praise the {{ link }}. The lid is described as being easy to screw on, with one simple counter-clockwise move. The cooker will display the pressure gauge level, heat level, timer, and it also lets you know when the cooking is about to begin on an LED readout screen in the front. One nifty feature is the ability to delay start time. You might find that this comes in handy when you're running late from the office and wish that dinner would cook itself. You can set the time and have dinner waiting for you when you get home.

The user interface is simple: choose your cooking option and set the timer. The cook pot is made of stainless steel and with pressure cookers at a similar price point, competitors tend to use Teflon non-stick coating for their cooking pots, which speaks about the quality of the {{ sn-link }}. Most people choose to opt for stainless steel as Teflon is being phased out due to concerns about its effect on health. A steel rack comes inside the cooker, allowing you to cook multiple foods at once, for example, meat at the bottom and veggies at the top. For people who are completely new to using pressure cookers, one reminder left by a helpful reviewer states that you need to allow some time to pass for the pressure to build up and start the cooking process. Likewise, when it is done you need to let the pressure drop down before you open the pot. Replacement parts are easily available on Amazon for the cooking pots and sealing ring, ensuring your pressure cooker lasts you for years. Most reviewers stated they were new to cooking or pressure cookers and were impressed with the ease of usage and the quality of meals this pressure cooker has helped them make. 

The cooker goes up to 8 quarts, with instructions saying you should fill the pot to about 60%, while buyers note that even 5 quarts is enough to feed a whole family, or 8-10 people if we're being specific. All of that, with less stress and even less clean-up time.The only gripe some customers have complained about is that the manual is not very intensive, which isn't a mark on the pressure cooker itself. Moreso, there is an owner's manual available online, but the cooker's simple design doesn't require much know-how. As a bonus, Amazon reviewers have shared their experiences with GoWISE customer support, and they are reported to be responsive and prompt. 

So, my verdict would be that if you're often in a rush and would like to save some time as well as get a headstart on that healthy eating lifestyle you've been wanting, the {{ link }} should fit your needs perfectly.
