Running on a treadmill has remained the most popular choice for people looking for a quick cardio workout, whether at home or gym. It is a no-brainer to use, and requires no in-depth understanding apart from, well, running. When we talk about treadmills for home use, there is a wide variety out there ranging from awful to fantastic. That's a broad spectrum. For someone who is looking around to buy one, this can get tedious very fast. This review is going to cover not one, but 2 treadmills of one of the most reliable brands out there, *NordicTrack*. The 6.5S and 6.5Si are the current popular offerings and this review touches both briefly to help out a potential cardio bunny.

NordicTrack fitness is a home equipment staple. The {{ sn-link }} is one of the company's least expensive home use treadmill, which makes it a great choice for home buyers. There's a console that gives 20 workout programs for complete novices. This variety ensures you don't get bored with the same old. It offers fat loss, LISS and HIIT programs, among others. If you have a subscription to the iFit program, it comes with access to the app, which opens the gateway to more workout programs. If you decide to purchase this treadmill, you get a free 30-day subscription to iFit. Features include heart rate monitoring, FlexSelect Cushioning, where you control the cushioning effect of the running belt, and is foldable. The LCD is backlit, has a music port and 2-inch speakers.

Starting off with some cons first, for seasoned runners, the {{ sn-link }} only has an incline of 10%. Therefore, if you are a runner on the more advanced side, you might choose to skip this purchase. Coming to what Amazon reviewers think of this equipment, it seems that you cannot use the treadmill unless you sign up for iFit. To get around this, buyers report holding down the iFit logo for 30 seconds. This was one of the biggest disadvantage users had a problem with, as this feature is not made aware to you when purchasing. Other cons include treadmill not having a cool down fan, or space to put in your phone or keys, which some people found off-putting. However, there are cup holders on each side. It is a larger piece of equipment, hence it requires at least 2 people to assemble. Assemble time was reported at an average of 30 minutes. The machine is described as being heavy to handle, and cannot fit through doors, so consider setting up in a place you wouldn't want to move from again. In case of faulty equipment, most people found the customer support services absymal. The hassle of cancelling an iFit subscription was not worth it to many people.

Coming to some positives, the build of the treadmill is reported to be sturdy and not shaky, even at higher incline and speeds. It was described as not being hard to set up, even if you tried doing it alone, although that will take longer as per helpful reviewers. Speed changes can be increased in fractional speeds in 10ths for 10 levels. A hydraulic system is built into the machine. It locks in place once you push it high enough. To move the treadmill part, you will need to depress the lever. Once the descent starts, you can let it touch the ground gently on its own, thanks to the hydraulic system. It works the same way once you want to push it upwards. This is a great plus for people who do not want to, or cannot, struggle with a heavy treadmill every time they want to exercise. There is a wedge in the main console where you can set an iPad, should you need to. Regarding noise levels, the reviews are in the favor of not as noisy as you would expect such heavy, big equipment to be. If you are an avid runner or marathon trainer, or simply cannot find the time to go to gym or run, this piece of equipment is described to give you what you need, a solid cardio workout at a solid price point.

The {{ sn-link }} series treadmill has similar features to the 6.5S, with the addition of a larger display screen serving as a console. The {{ sn-link }} has a 10 inch screen that is interactive. With the purchase of this treadmill, you get a 1 year subscription to iFit, whereas the ***6.5S*** gives you one month only. It also has a 2.6 CHP motor, which allows for more power than other treadmills in the range. A very neat feature allows the ***6.5Si*** technology to show a trainer on screen that can control your machine's incline level and speed. This one also has a library of 20 workout programs which feature world class level fitness trainers to guide you through. The treadmill belt length is 55''. Another addition to this treadmill are non-flex rollers, along with the predecessor's patented FlexSelect cushioning, which allows for non-jerky treadmill movements. This has a less harsh impact on your joints, causing them lesser strain.

### Conclusion

The ***6.5Si treadmill*** is much the same as the ***6.5S*** with added features. This means that the cons for ***6.5S*** apply to the *6.5Si* as well. Compared to other treadmills in this price range under $1000, there is a balance between value for money and what features the {{ sn-link }} equipment offers. In a nutshell, it is quiet, sturdy, and has variety workouts, which is good enough for beginner runners and at-home cardio workouts.
