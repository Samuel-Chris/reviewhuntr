Mobile phones have been catered towards the mainstream market since their inception, but today gamers and power-hungry enthusiasts can rejoice. The all-new {{ link }} is packed with cutting edge hardware and sophisticated software. With enough power to make any mobile gamer drool, the {{ link }} hits the sweet spot in regards to price and performance. Coming in at just shy of 400$, it’s much cheaper than the latest thousand dollar iPhones.
Overall, the phone is built with a fairly premium feel. You can opt for a matte black finish, or go with the regal satin finish. The phone has one of the best displays on the market, and hardware to match it. The phone also has Razer’s innovative Chroma software for all your lighting needs. The phone comes with android 9, and a free version of the acclaimed Nova Launcher. The dual front-facing speakers are super loud and feature Dolby’s Atmos technology, which seeks to enhance mobile audio for specific use cases. Overall, the {{ link }} is a solid phone, and ill be getting into the specifics in the next section.
 The {{ link }} has one of the best displays of any mobile phone. A 120Hz panel allows you to experience ultra-high refresh rate gaming. Most of you are probably reading this review on a standard 60Hz monitor, half as fast as the {{ link }}’s panel. Coming in at around 5.72 inches, it’s not a small display by any means. Gorilla Glass 5 ensures your phone safety, being rated to survive a 1.6m fall 80% of the time. The {{ link }} truly has a world-class display.
 Most people buy this phone for gaming and it doesn’t disappoint at all in that department. If you're looking for crisp audio to any headset, the onboard USB-C DAC port will give you high fidelity 24-bit audio. If you’re a speaker person, the {{ link }} won’t disappoint. Dual front-facing speakers provide clean audio, and Dolby Atmos ensures it caters to your use case. If you’re listening to music or talking with friends, Atmos will cater to your needs. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 this phone comes with provides the power you need to tackle even the most graphically demanding games. From PUBG to Fortnite, you can be sure you’ll be running them at the highest graphical presets. An onboard vapour chamber provides efficient cooling for this powerful processor. Graphics matter and the Adreno 630 GPU was born to deliver them. Being one of the fastest mobile GPUs in existence, it crushes and mobile game at any setting. Overall, the {{ link }} lives and breathes gaming.
 Battery life is important, especially so when you are gaming. Imagine being in a 1v1 situation in your favourite battle total game, only for your phone to power off from the low battery life of your generic phone. The {{ link }} packs a 4,000mAh battery, enough to easily go through a full day of demanding usage. The USB-C port allows you to charge your phone in no time at all. Powering the powerful display and CPU is no small task, and the battery delivers with flying colours. Few users have any complaints about the impressive battery.
 Memory is something that mobile gamers often overlook, but it matters nonetheless. Modern games are now always a few gigabytes, so it's important to have space for them. The {{ link }} has a comfortable 64 Gigabytes of UFS storage. This isn’t as big as some of the modern flagships, but the {{ link }} has a trick up its sleeve. It features a micro SD slot that can hold up to 1 Terabyte of flash memory. Aside from storage, RAM is also important in terms of memory. The {{ link }} comes with a nice 8GB of LPDDR4X of RAM, more than enough to comfortably multitask and play games. 
 Gamers aren’t the type of people who require an amazing camera, but Razer still delivered in this department. The front camera is a decent 8MP one, recording up to 1080p video. This isn't super cutting edge but more of a nice to have feature. The rear camera, however, is a completely different story. It has a dual-camera setup with image stabilization built-in. The first camera is a stabilized 12MP wide shot lens. The second one is a telephoto with a 12MP sensor. The dual-tone flash makes night time pictures a breeze. You can record video up to 4k, fairly impressive in a gaming phone like this. Overall, the {{ link }} packs a good camera on a phone that didn't even need it.

## Conclusion

Overall, this is an amazing phone catered mostly to gamers. It's feature-rich and allows you all the comforts of a flagship for a fraction of the price. A 4-star rating on Amazon is nothing to scoff at either.
