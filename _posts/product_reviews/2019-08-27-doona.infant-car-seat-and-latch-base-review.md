Taking care of a newborn can be hard and even more so with families that travel regularly. For most parents, they have to lug around bulky car seats and a separate stroller anytime they have to be on the go. This can get tiring pretty quick. It's basically an upper body cardio workout! The [***Doona Infant Car Seat & Latch Base***](https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&refinements=p_36%3A30000-&rnid=386430011&s=baby-products&sr=1-6&th=1&tag=reviewhuntr-20) is a nifty game-changer released by the company *Simple Parenting*. This car seat is the first that can also transform into a stroller! Is that a dream come true or what? Well, maybe not quite, but it does seem to be the time and energy saving solution for parents. Customers report ease of usage with the [***Doona car seat***](https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&refinements=p_36%3A30000-&rnid=386430011&s=baby-products&sr=1-6&th=1&tag=reviewhuntr-20), with mothers who frequent public transport heaving a sigh of relief over the foldability and portability of this car seat-stroller. 

The [***Doona seat***](https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&refinements=p_36%3A30000-&rnid=386430011&s=baby-products&sr=1-6&th=1&tag=reviewhuntr-20) comes in 10 colors and has a minimalistic design, transforming into a compact stroller with just a push of a lever. Parents who have busy lives and errands to run are absolutely smitten with this feature. Your purchase comes with the infant car seat base. It also comes with an extensive list on how to properly install and use the seat. Buyers shared that it also comes with a recall-list paper that you can get registered on and you can get notified in case of leaving your baby accidentally in the car. A car seat protector is also in the package, in case of spills or other accidents. The infant insert and the head supporting cushion are made with bamboo fabric. Youtube tutorials give you guidance on how to set it up and get started. It is recommended by customers to use it on your own before putting baby in it in order to get a feel for it. 

The [*Doona*](https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&refinements=p_36%3A30000-&rnid=386430011&s=baby-products&sr=1-6&th=1&tag=reviewhuntr-20) also meets FAA standards, which means you can bring this with you on a plane. It saves you storage space in your car and your apartment. Buyers agree that the [*Doona*](https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&refinements=p_36%3A30000-&rnid=386430011&s=baby-products&sr=1-6&th=1&tag=reviewhuntr-20) is simple and easy to maneuver, even one handed. This is a nice quirk for people who like to sip coffee on the go, or have to hold on to the sibling's hand. Some people have commented on how heavy the [*Doona*](https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&refinements=p_36%3A30000-&rnid=386430011&s=baby-products&sr=1-6&th=1&tag=reviewhuntr-20) weighs when you pick it up. The [***Doona car seat***](https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&refinements=p_36%3A30000-&rnid=386430011&s=baby-products&sr=1-6&th=1&tag=reviewhuntr-20) weighs 15 pounds. Most moms say they'd pick some extra strength expenditure for the benefit of having what equals to a convertible car seat. As a stroller, it is reported to be easily maneuvered through aisles, restaurants, city corners, and airplanes. It comes with an insert to support newborns, and the canopy over the head extends downwards. Wheels are reportedly durable for both sidewalk and grassland walks and the one-touch brakes are described to be smooth.  

As a car seat, which it is primarily, it comes equipped with some safety features in place. A 5- point safety harness makes sure your baby is good and secure in his crib. The handles also serve as anti-rebound bars. The wheel enclosure have a double-wall structure, which gives a 3 layer Side Impact Protection, with EPS foam layers. Once you decide to convert it into a stroller, you just pull up the handle and you're good to go. The position of the handlebar is low enough that the older sibling can take over the duty of switching the seat into the stroller. The car seat is virtually impossible to fold accidentally. Neither will the handle pop out in carry mode. These safety features were designed keeping in mind both the parents as well as the baby. The [*Doona's*](https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&refinements=p_36%3A30000-&rnid=386430011&s=baby-products&sr=1-6&th=1&tag=reviewhuntr-20) Infant Insert was designed specially in order to support and cradle newborns in their first month of life, by engineers and medical professionals. It is an almost flat design which ensures that the baby's neck and back are in alignment ergonomically. The [***Doona car seat***](https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&refinements=p_36%3A30000-&rnid=386430011&s=baby-products&sr=1-6&th=1&tag=reviewhuntr-20) is the only one to have been certified as a car seat and a stroller that provides complete safety for your little one.     

The [***Doona seat***](https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&refinements=p_36%3A30000-&rnid=386430011&s=baby-products&sr=1-6&th=1&tag=reviewhuntr-20) can handle up to 35lb of weight and up to 32 inches in height. It is rear facing, and not forward facing, which some customers wished it was. Buyers have reported that they need to buy separate accessories as it has no space, baskets, or under the stroller storage for milk and water bottles or other small things. Accessories that the company offers separately alongside the [*Doona*](https://www.amazon.com/Doona-Infant-Seat-Latch-Base/dp/B07HML1BT5/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1566904150&refinements=p_36%3A30000-&rnid=386430011&s=baby-products&sr=1-6&th=1&tag=reviewhuntr-20) include rain covers, snap-on storage, sunshade, an essentials bag and an all-day bag. But if you want to bypass all of that, you can simply buy a bike bag as a quick fix to carry around your diapers and wipes, as shared by one mom in an Amazon review. The only other major setback with this handy seat is the price tag. Some people are skeptical of shelling out $500 for something their baby will outgrow. Some people don't travel about enough for this seat to be handy. But the majority customers agree that the investment is worth it for those moments of ease, convenience, and flexibility. No separate travel system in place required, you just pop the wheels of the Doona and secure it in place. **A must-have for parents that value their time and are on the go.**
