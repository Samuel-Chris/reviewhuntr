I must admit that I wasn't a coffee fan until recently. I couldn't understand the hype about it until I tried this one coffee from this one local place, and now I'm a convert. I wanted to recreate the experience but then I found out that it's pretty hard to make good coffee unless you have a solid machine to do the work for you. Disappointed, I turned to Google to help me out, and came across the {{ link }}. Here, I will proceed to gather all the information and reviews I found in one neat little post so you can check it out and decide for yourself in case you're in a similar spot as myself. 

So, the first thing that people found attractive about this machine was its small size. It is compact at 14 inches and weighs in at 28.1 lbs, which I've come to learn is actually pretty modest for coffee machines. This is a great option for those with limited countertop space or small kitchens. It's a good looking machine, with a silvery, metallic front side and black plastic sides and top. It gives off a very sleek and minimalistic home-style vibe. Now, the {{ sn-link }} has a large reservoir, able to hold 60 ounces of water at once. Remember that this machine was made to brew a cup at a time, rather than a whole pot. However, buyers note that the front panel controls give you the opportunity to adjust your cup size to 8 ounces, and you can then choose to add a "double shot".
This will give you a double drink of 16 ounces. There is the ability to make 2 cups at the same time with the choice of one or two cup button. Now, most super automatic machines have their reservoir in the back. For the {{ sn-link}, you can gain access to it from the front. This makes it more convenient to use. People who like to run on coffee day to day can appreciate this at-home coffee maker, thanks to the bigger reservoir size.

Super automatic espresso machines utilize "beans-to-brew", and this beast is no different. Its design is best suited for medium-roast coffee, as oily beans are reported by Amazon buyers to clog up the whole machine's system. When it comes to the grinder, the bean hopper is described to hold around 7 ounces of coffee, which you refill from the top of the machine. 
Next to the hopper, you'll find dials for grind setting, which enables you to adjust the coarseness of the grind to your liking. Most hardcore coffee drinkers already know that a good cup of coffee requires the perfect grind level, otherwise you just end up with subpar coffee. Apart from the grind setting and the "extraction rate" knob, there's a "contact time" knob which lets you decide how long you want the water to be in contact with the grounds. As shared by users, the noise level of the machine is relatively on the lower side when  compared it to owners' previously owned machines.

The best part for people like me, who are not as well versed in the world of coffee yet, is the fact that this machine accommodates for ground coffee as well. There is a bypass doser on top of the machine, under a hatch you lift up, between the bean hopper and warming tray. The purchase comes with a scooper so all you need to do is put the grounds in, set the dials and press the brew button. Isn't that awesome? 

Now I can have traditional pick-me-up coffee in the morning, and ground decaf coffee in the evening. From the reviews I've gathered, some users have shared that using water that has been distilled is a top priority to keep your machine running smooth and living long. The unit is reported to require some maintenance to keep it running as it did on the first day and keep things moving. Once in a while, a light will blink to know you need to descale it, and if you use filtered water the time between descaling will increase drastically. 

The only few cons reported were that you cannot see when the beans are running low, and hardcore coffee drinkers complained that the reservoir wasn't big enough and required topping every so often. 

The {{ link }} has been noted as easy to use: just add water and the machine will automatically add beans to the hopper as needed. The whole coffee making process is said to take roughly 5 minutes. For people in a hurry in the morning, this is a pretty good feature to have. This unit has the ability to run a clean cycle when started and also when shutting down. Its head/filter unit is removable and hence easy to clean, and overall customers report this machine manages ground coffee better than most other models. 
People who self-described themselves as not so experienced with coffee making machines or even coffee in general were comfortable in choosing the {{ link }} as their go-to. Professionals who had used manual machines in the past reviewed their satisfaction with the {{ sn-link }}, and appreciate they don't have to fill filters, empty grounds and so on. The machine does all that for you and used grounds are deposited into a container present on the right side. It requires to be emptied about every 10 cups, and has no environment-harming pods to waste. With drip coffee machines, people report to usually end up with a lot more than they needed, which all then goes to waste. But the {{ sn-link }} is customizable to your tastes and requirements, has lesser waste, and has easy maintenance.
