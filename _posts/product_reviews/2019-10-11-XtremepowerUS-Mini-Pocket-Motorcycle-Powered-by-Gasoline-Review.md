In today's day and age of smartphones and tablets, parents are more concerned about limiting their kids' screen time than ever before. 
While being educated through these devices is important and getting familiarized with new technology remains crucial for the future progress of children, we all know that there is much more to life than tech.

 It is also imperative that you get some outdoor playtime in the mix so they could get some physical exercise and thrive in a balanced environment.



But doing so is not easy. In a world where computer graphics could represent their imagination, kids are hardly interested in playing outdoor games. That is where parents' creativity comes in, so they could introduce new ways to keep their kids involved in outdoor activities.

But what's the best way to accomplish this objective?

Pocket bikes might be a straightforward solution. They are fun, safe, and enjoyable for kids, allowing parents to have peace of mind when their kids are out and about in the real world.

To make sure that your kids get optimal playtime outside of their screens and the confinement of your home, you could turn to the {{ link }}.

The motorcycle is powered by gasoline and provides the same riding experience that is offered by a conventional motorcycle. 

The {{ sn-link }} comprises of a steel frame and chain drive transmission. It also has a 40cc 4-stroke engine, which is approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) due to being safe for the environment.

It claims to provide a mileage of 26 miles per filled tank.

With one brake disc each in the front and rear, the motorcycle allows kids to make safe stops whenever they need them. To make sure that children stay safe during their drive, the motorcycle also provides automatic, one-speed transmission. Since the seat is padded and the handlebar angle is adjustable, the motorcycle also claims to give the kids a posture that makes riding the motorcycle a fun and comfortable experience for them.

When it comes to practical use, the 4-stroke, the gasoline-powered engine does its job quite efficiently and provides a real motorcycle riding experience to kids. It has been noted by users that the {{ sn-link }} emulates a conventional motorcycle perfectly, and lets kids enjoy the motorcycle riding experience in a way that's suitable and safe for their age.

 In fact, the assembly of the {{ sn-link }} is one of those aspects that get lauded the most.

With that being said, the motorcycle seems to be too small for kids over 10 to ride. Users have noted that the {{ sn-link }} really takes to delivering the "mini" in its name, and proves to be too small for even 8-9-year-olds who are just a bit taller than their age. Seeing that most users who bought the motorcycle for older kids seem to be having this problem but those who have bought the motorcycle for smaller kids seem to be quite happy with it. It is best that you keep this in mind while making your purchase.

From bright colors to neutral tones, the motorcycle provides you with the option to select something that would be an instant hit with your kid.

Almost every kid it is gifted to goes over the moon with joy at receiving their own motorcycle that is specifically made for their size.

## Conclusion

The {{ link }} remains quite a great gift item for children because it provides plenty of fun, while also being an educational experience that would teach kids how to be responsible with their own vehicles when they reach adulthood.



With that being said, it should be noted that the small size of the motorcycle could be an issue if your child is taller than their age. However, that seems to be the only issue with the motorcycle. The other features seem to be extremely helpful for children who would be using their motorcycle every day without any problems.
