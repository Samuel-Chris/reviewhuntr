A smartwatch often provides a simple and easy way to stay connected without needing to pick up your phone, allowing you to answer calls and check your notifications quickly. They are also particularly useful if you want to track your workout routines and any progress towards a fitness goal.

They compact everything you need from your phone, but in a more discreet and professional design, ideal for starting and ending meetings on time and returning calls promptly without constantly interrupting work in progress.

The most recent addition to this line of devices is the {{ link }}. Apple Watches are known for using a wireless connection to an iPhone to perform functions such as calling and texting and can also connect to Wi-Fi network for additional tasks. However, since Series 3 and later LTE Apple Watches can independently connect to a mobile network, bypassing the need for an iPhone after their initial setup. This is a huge improvement, as it allows the user to work separately from their phones, making for a more independent device. 


This best-selling wearable device includes an always-on display with energy-saving OLED screen and low-power screen driver capable of refresh rates as low as once per second. Additional new features include International Emergency Calling enabling emergency calls in over 150 countries, a more power-efficient S5 processor, improved ambient sensor, doubling of storage to 32GB, and the addition of a magnetometer, which enables a compass function useful for traveling and hiking trips. 

One of the main advantages of an {{ sn-link }} is Siri. Having easy access to an assistant is amazing. With an {{ sn-link }} you'll be able to ask Siri for anything you might need, be it the weather, setting an alarm, or even multiple commands, and it'll be done in the blink of an eye. Pairing an {{ sn-link }} with a home kit can be particularly useful, and it will help you automate multiple tasks simply with a voice command. Home kits range from locks to speakers, smart plugs or even light strips that can be controlled easily. 

The second advantage of an {{ sn-link }} is organization. You'll have your calendar, meetings, timers, and access to different time zones, all so you can correctly plan and distribute your tasks throughout the day.

{{ sn-link }} can also be customized to suit your needs. You can change the watch band and it'll feel like having a new watch altogether, as the different designs can go from classy to casual or sport. Changing the watch face is very simple, and it'll help you display the information you consider necessary, all with one touch.

The {{ link }} received positive reviews, reaching a promising rating of 4.5 stars out of 5 on Amazon.

On this device, the users have commented about the band, which is sturdy and strong but without being rigid or uncomfortable. The design and build quality have been praised, as well. 

Purchasers have found Apple Watch's ability to track sleep, heart rate and calories very useful. Others have found this device very practical when walking their dog, as this smartwatch foregoes the need for a phone, and it's easier to use when dealing with a leash or busy hands.

The Series 5 seems to be a big upgrade when compared to its predecessors. The slightly bigger screen has been accepted positively and new features such as cellular and Wi-Fi have been considered a major improvement. 

When reading the negative reviews, the biggest complaint was that this smartwatch needs to be activated via an iPhone before its first use. Some users experienced troubles when activating it, while others said it's very easy to set up and sync with an iPhone. So in this topic, it seems to be more of a technical issue than a problem with the smartwatch itself.

Some said that the {{ link }} is by far the best version of {{ sn-link }} yet. The always-on display has received favorable reviews, and it's said that it brings the smartwatch closer to an actual watch. With this new addition, the screen stays always on but dims slightly when your wrist is turned away from you. 
This feature can be turned off if the user would rather not have the screen always lit. However, the always-on can be useful when you need to glance at the time without having to wake it up, as it would be in a meeting or a professional setting.

The battery life is said to have vastly improved over previous versions, even with the always-on feature turned on. 

Users had a positive surprise with the quality of the speaker. According to some reviewers, it sounds just like the iPhone 11 Pro speaker, very clear and with a wide range for lower and higher frequencies.

Users commented that the screen auto-adjusts to light better than previous generations and that the ECG sensor is particularly good and accurate, which makes this smartwatch ideal for tracking general daily activities and workouts.

The Series 5 has 32GB of storage versus 16GB on the Series 3, this means more space for music, podcasts or apps.

But what's been undoubtedly most praised are the improvements to the LTE version and the way it connects to AT&T network, which allows you to leave your phone behind. This makes the Series 5 a worthy upgrade from an {{ sn-link }} Series 3. In previous non-LTE versions, the phone connects to your iPhone via Bluetooth so you have to be within 25 feet of your phone to sync). Because of this, users had to always keep their phone close, which defeated the purpose of having a smartwatch. The LTE version helps you reduce screen time, as you can leave your phone home without the fear missing out on an important phone call or text. 
  

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the {{ link }} is a device you wonâ€™t regret purchasing, given its multiple uses and how versatile it can be. Some users go as far as to call it "the best smartwatch ever."
