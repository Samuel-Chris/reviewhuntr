With the recent advancements in technology, various new tools have come to the forefront to improve the work processes of the everyday professional. With that, these tools have proven to be an excellent way for casual users to have fun with technology. These new technologies have opened doors to a multitude of professional and recreational opportunities, which make the lives of users so much better.

 
Drone technology is a prime example of that. While highly used by surveillance and law enforcement agencies, they also prove to be an excellent fit for professionals such as photographers, researchers, engineers, and rescue operators. But they are not limited by that application. They also prove to be just as equally suitable for those who want to use the technology for fun.

Promising to be a great fit for a variety of applications, the {{ sn-link }}, equipped with a 4K HDR Camera claims to be one such addition to the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology market.



Sporting a 4K HDR camera with a 21 MP Sony sensor, the drone can film in 4K, Full HD or 2.7K videos, as well as 21MP photos. It also boasts up to 2.8 times digital zoom with a f/2.4 wide angle ASPH lens. The drone is a quadcopter that can be folded easily, all while sporting a 180° vertical swivel camera. It also claims to have wind resistance of up to 31 mp/h and a Wi-Fi connection range of up to 2.5 miles (4 km).

Apart from these features, the {{ sn-link }} also comes with special applications to make UAV flying easier. With FreeFlight 6 and Parrot Skycontroller 3, the drone claims to make the act of flying this UAV simple yet safer for pilots of any skill level. It also boasts of a weight of 320g, which makes it quite mobile-friendly. It also provides 25 minutes of in-flight battery time, with the ability to be charged with external batteries through a USB-C port.

The {{ sn-link }} is built to be helpful to novice UAV pilots. For instance, its software is programmed to take off or land with just a single button, with the function to return to its starting point in case of signal loss.

With optimized exposure control and the ability to expand the memory using micro SD cards, the {{ sn-link }} claims to be the perfect drone for those who are delving into UAV flying for the first time. The drone is also available in four packages, which all come with a standard 16 GB micro SD card for memory, and additional software according to the package selected.


The Base package comes with just the drone, a remote controller, and a battery. But the Extended package also has a carrying case, two batteries, and two months of access to Adobe Creative Cloud. The Work package contains the feature of creating 3D models using Pix4Dmodel, while also having a carrying case and four batteries. Whereas, the Thermal kit comes with two cameras in the drone for thermal imaging, as well as a carrying case, three batteries, and software support for thermal imaging applications.

Users note that the {{ sn-link }} is relatively easy to use, which makes it an excellent fit for those who are still learning to fly UAVs. With that, those who have used it professionally also seem to like how simple it is to fly. Some praise the software, which makes it very easy to understand and operate the Anafi Drone, while others point towards the drone’s compact and virtually noiseless operation as its best quality.



As explained above, the battery life of the {{ sn-link }} is supposed to last for 25 minutes in-flight time. With external batteries that could charge the Anafi Drone for another 25 minutes each, it gets easier to get more flight time out of the drone when you do not have access to a direct power source. Users have noted that this ability, combined with the accurate assessment of backup time makes the {{ sn-link }} pretty comfortable to operate as compared to other drones that need owners to find power outlets here and there.

 
With its 4K camera that comes with a Sony sensor and an f/2.4 wide-angle ASPH lens, the {{ sn-link }} claims to take high-quality videos and images. According to users, this claim is not far off the mark, since the {{ sn-link }} actually does capture clear images that are suitable for commercial applications, such as checking heightened structures for construction issues or taking aerial videos or images for promotional media.

 
The 320g weight, as well as its compact structure, also work in the drone’s favor, with users noting that they perhaps remain the best features of the {{ link }}. Since the drone is extremely light and foldable, it could be carried by any professional or UAV enthusiast on their travels easily - all without adding any significant weight to their existing equipment.

Since the {{ link }} comes at an affordable price of $700, users also praise its overall value proposition as compared to its total cost. With the ability for expandable storage, external batteries, and return to home feature in the face of signal loss, the {{ sn-link }} proves itself to be a multi-purpose UAV that could easily hold its own within a variety of sectors.

With that, some users have complained about how the {{ link }} doesn’t hold up to its promises of being able to hold against windy conditions. Other than that, the drone seems to be getting pretty good reviews by those who use it casually or who indulge in aerial photography regularly.

## Conclusion

The {{ link }} seems to be the right choice for those who want to use it for aerial imaging that serves a variety of commercial purposes. With that being said, it might cause a few issues for those who use it in windy conditions, since the lightweight feature might prove to be a disadvantage in such situations.
 
But overall, the {{ sn-link }} is great for taking high-quality images and being a good fit for easy UAV flying, as well as a suitable option for those who want a drone to provide aerial visuals for their primary professional responsibilities.

Furthermore, it could also be an excellent option for those who wish to use an affordable yet high-quality drone for casual UAV flying.
