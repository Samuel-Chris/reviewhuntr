It's no secret that Apple products are always a safe option. In terms of functionality, Apple is known for their user-friendly products, easy to use but continuously evolving.

As technology continues to advance, Apple has remained consistent in what they offer: a clean modern look and feel for all their products, while also providing quality and durability.

It's not a surprise, then, that Apple has become a symbol that stands out in between other leader brands. What started as a computer company, is now famous for its phones, music, TV, and even watch technology. They are a solid and reliable, and consumers know they can trust in them to provide fresh yet outstanding products.

The [***27" iMac***](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q1NBCVB/ref=fs_a_md_0&tag=reviewhuntr-20) whose main feature is a **Retina 5K** display, has been in the market since 2014, for almost five years.

It's the last iMac product released by Apple (not counting the iMac Pro, released in 2017). However, this doesn't mean that the 27" iMac Retina 5K is outdated. Far from it, Apple is a company known for a slow approach when designing new hardware. They are notable for spending years trying to perfect their products to make sure that they are the best they can be.

In fact, one of their Apple designers was quoted in saying: *“Our goals are very simple — to design and make better products. If we can’t make something that is better, we won’t do it.”*

Since the birth of the company, many models have been scrapped and deemed not good enough for release. Apple makes sure their products meet all the requirements and are perfect for release, taking the time (years) before finally releasing them. Therefore, you can be sure that the [***Mac Retina 5K***](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q1NBCVB/ref=fs_a_md_0&tag=reviewhuntr-20) is created with the best technology Apple can offer to this day.

This model was designed with professional photographers and video editors in mind, with the 5K resolution allowing 4K video to be played at its native resolution in Final Cut Pro.

In terms of storage, it offers the best option in the market so far: space *and* speed. A Fusion Drive, faster and more efficient than its predecessors. The processor is a new seventh-generation Intel Core, offering more speed than any iMac has reached before.

And of course, what gives this iMac the name: the Retina 5K Display. With a pixel density so high you can't detect a single one, to the color accuracy and vibrancy, it's clearly the best addition so far.

Most of the reviews have been positive, allowing the [***27" iMac Retina 5K***](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q1NBCVB/ref=fs_a_md_0&tag=reviewhuntr-20) to reach a rating of 4.5 stars out of 5, with particular interest in the screen quality (rated unanimously 5 stars).

Users commented that this model is able to run many apps at the same time without degradation over time. The screen size and resolution has been said to be perfect. The colors are brilliant and sharp. The increased size of the screen allows for the user to have many windows open at the time and switch easily between them. The greater width gives allows for more dock space to keep the user's most preferred programs available at a glance.

The speed of the processor has been the focal point of many reviewers, which were left amazed by the upgrade when compared to previous models. The combination of both a good operative system (the High Sierra OS optimizes storage and performance), and the processor both contribute to make the iMac faster and enhance the user's experience. Graphic designers have commented that the performance is the best they've ever worked with. The core processor and Radeon Pro 570x graphics card make both 4K and VR video possible to both view and edit.  The operative system --- High Sierra OS --- is said to work flawlessly and meet the user's expectations. The built in speakers have been praised as well for their quality and the vibrant sound they produce.

The iMac comes with a rechargeable Magic Mouse and a rechargeable Magic Keyboard. They charge via lightning cable. The keyboard can be used while it's charging, but the mouse has received negative comments because the port is underneath and therefore, cannot be used when connected.

On this, a few users said the keyboard is too small and uncomfortable, while the wide majority claimed the keyboard was extremely useful and praised the compact design. The mouse was "too flat" to some reviewers.

There were some negative comments regarding the features, or lack thereof. Some commented the SuperDrive is no longer part of the machine, and the purchase of an external DVD drive is needed if the user wants to read or write DVDs or CDs.

Other thing to pay attention to, is that the new iMac comes with Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) as opposed to older models that used Thunderbolt 2. In this case, an adapter is needed in order to connect and operate the hard drives.
### Conclusion

Overall, this model has been said to be an excellent Apple product. Despite the minor complains, users agree that iMacs are the most reliable desktops. Since their hardware and software are designed by the same company, there are no compatibility problems.

To attest to the quality of the product, there are also some reviews from users who purchased the iMac five years ago, commenting on the performance and durability, and how it keeps working flawlessly despite the passage of time.

Most buyers go as far as to call the [***iMac Retina 5K***](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q1NBCVB/ref=fs_a_md_0&tag=reviewhuntr-20), "the best computer they've ever owned."
