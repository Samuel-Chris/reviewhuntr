Sleep. Everyone wants and needs it, but only a specific percentage of the population actually gets it.

  

Why?

  

Who knows.

  

I'd wager that our lack of sleep may be due to our fascination with our devices, and the blue light emanating from our screens. Insomnia may also be a cause of our hectic work schedules, which may prevent us from a sound sleep. Whatever the case may be, we all know that fantastic sleep helps us to think, act, and perform better overall.

  

Me? I'm a big fan of sleep. I think sleep is a time to slow all the way down in an increasingly fast-paced world. Our time of hibernation provides us with the opportunity to rest, relax, and give ourselves a break.

  

That's why I started looking into products that might improve and enhance my sleeping experience. I heard about the {{ link }}: The Weighted Blanket for Sleep, Stress, and Anxiety sometime ago when they did their Kickstarter campaign, but I didn't really pay too much attention to it. Since I'm more focused on sleep now, I figured I'd take a look at the {{ link }}: The Weighted Blanket for Sleep, Stress, and Anxiety and see what it was all about.

  

The {{ link }} is especially intriguing because it is supposed to be a "premium-grade weighted blanket" that helps with stress, and anxiety. It helps to improve sleep and minimizes stress and anxiety. It improves the cycle of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep while increasing serotonin and melatonin and is said to feel amazing. What's not to love?

  
  

The {{ link }}: The Weighted Blanket For Sleep, Stress, and Anxiety

The company states that the {{ link }} was created with your satisfaction and comfort in mind. From features such as an ultra-soft duvet cover to the additions of enclosed glass beads, the blanket is supposed to revolutionize your sleep experience.

  

But does it really?

  

Let's talk about the specifications and the overall make of the {{ link }}.

  

One can purchase the {{ link }} in several weights, 15 pounds, 20 pounds, and 25 pounds. The company recommends {{ sn-link }} sleepers to buy blanket weights that are about 10% of one's body weight.

  

The {{ link }} comes in one size 72" x 48". It's not supposed to be for two people, just one. The idea is that an individual will feel maximum comfort when they cover themselves with the blanket. The weighted distribution of the blanket that encompasses the body of the individual is where the {{ sn-link }} magic happens.

  

So it is essential to remember not to share this blanket, lest ye sacrifice thine comfort.

  

But how is the {{ link }} made?

  

{{ sn-link }} states that the blanket's exterior is comprised of extra "soft micro-fleece." Its internal weighted layer is comprised of cotton and weighted beads. This inner layer is held securely by ties and elastic-button straps.

  

How must you care for the blanket? It’s simple. Machine wash the exterior but be gentle, and hand wash the interior.

  

The blanket comes in two colors, navy and space grey. But most people go with space grey probably because it just looks cooler.

  

Now, that we've got the basics covered, let's take a look at the feedback on the {{ link }}s.

  

Here's What People Love about the {{ link }}s

Most people think that it is a fantastic blanket that's amazingly soft and cozy. Users also find that it serves its purpose as a weighted blanket, helping them sleep like a baby. They have also seen that it does make them feel more secure, and it increases their comfort.

  

Many are right in line with the fact that the blanket is only made for one person, so those who loved it purchased one for their significant other. Users with a reported problem of a lack of proper sleep, especially those who previously had less than 3 hours of sleep at night note that the {{ link }} has helped them sleep for more than 5 hours regularly.

  

People have also used it in a variety of places, on the bed, on the couch, and chairs as well. Those that really love the {{ link }}s provide one bit of caution, you might not ever want to leave your bed. With it, users are also pleased with the {{ sn-link }} customer service team.

  

The product does work as generally advertised, but there have been a few recurring drawbacks with the {{ link }}.

  

Here's What People Hate about the {{ link }}s

  

The Blanket is Said to Be Too Hot

Many talk about the fact that these {{ link }}s are too hot. Too much heat leads to sweating. Sweating leads to uncomfortable sleep, and restless sleep leads to unhappy people.

  

But fear not, there's a solution.

  

Users have resolved this problem in several ways. For one, they have turned down the temperature in their rooms and/or placed another blanket between themselves and the {{ link }}. It is important to remember that depending upon your body temperature, you might feel that the blanket is a bit too warm and might need to do as those who have faced these similar problems.

  

It Reportedly Has Uneven Weight Distribution

Users note that the blanket has the weight, but it feels as if all the weight goes to the sides of the blanket. This may seem like a significant problem because the whole point of the {{ link }} is to provide users with that sensational cozy, hugged, and snug feel. Without the proper distribution of weight, the blanket might turn out to be more of a hassle and may not meet users’ expectations.

  

It Has Shown Inconsistent Quality to a Few Users

Some users say that the product as inconsistencies in quality. A few users purchased several blankets and experienced a difference in quality. While some of the {{ link }}s have stayed true and durable over time, others have a smaller use life. Issues such as the poor quality of the threads on coverlets, beads congregating on one side of the blanket, and other problems are a concern among a small portion of the users. With that being said, most users swear by the {{ link }} and mention that it has provided them with no issues.

  

The Price is High - But Now There’s a Discount

Users who purchased it at the original price feel that they overpaid. According to them, they would have been more comfortable with the product if they bought it a discount.

  

At the time of writing, the {{ link }} is available at a steep discount, which helps in resolving this argument.

  

## Conclusion

The {{ link }} works really well for some and not so well for others. Users with different bodies (temperatures, weight, and height) react differently to the blanket. Most people love it and would purchase the product. The {{ link }} is currently at a steep discount and has all the potential to act as a valued purchase for most people.
