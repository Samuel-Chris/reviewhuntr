The sound of music is one of the very few things in the world that could draw the favorable attention of anyone regardless of their age, gender, or social setting. Whether you are an entrepreneur or an entry-level professional, an ambitious student, or a hardworking artist, listening to some great music is never out of the question.
 
After all, the music is that one thing in the world that could very quickly make you feel a ton of emotions depending upon the genre. Only by choosing an artist or a type of music, would you feel relaxed, motivated, reflective, or soothed in an instant.

This notion is all the more profound when your music is delivered free of distortion, latency, and muffled sounds. That is why you must choose hardware that provides you with superior sound quality, impressive imaging, and crystal clear notes.
 
The [***Audeze LCD-4 Over Ear Headphones***](https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&tag=reviewhuntr-20) rise to the challenge with a promise to meet these requirements with ease. For the most part, these high-end headphones also succeed by an impressive margin.
 
For starters, the [***Audeze LCD-4***](https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&tag=reviewhuntr-20) comes with one of a kind nano-scale diaphragm that is lighter than air. Yes, you read that right. The diaphragm is so thin and light that this level of excellence in diaphragm development is exclusive to Audeze. In real-world terms, it promises the most accurate bass response among any commercial headphones on the planet.
 
With that, the diaphragm also allows the headphones to provide better imaging during playtime. What’s even better is that these claims are strengthened by users’ reviews, who support Audeze’s superiority in sound delivery through the [***LCD-4***](https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&tag=reviewhuntr-20).
 
The diaphragm’s abilities are further enhanced by the magnet array technology included in the [LCD-4](https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&tag=reviewhuntr-20). With Double Fluxor Magnet Arrays, the headphones provide exceptional magnetic flux to an astounding 1.5 Tesla. This concept translates into a fantastic performance by offering more excellent resolution and a massively improved transient response as compared to its counterparts. The quality that these features add to the sound delivery is heavily noted by those who use the headphones.
 
What further adds to the nano-scale diaphragm and the magnet arrays of the [***Audeze LCD-4***](https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&tag=reviewhuntr-20) is its Fazor Elements. The technology, which has been patented by Audeze, is proficient in guiding soundwaves to provide a clearer and accurate waveform. Users note that this translates to the headphones projecting the overall sound quality.
 
Made with ebony wood and leather ear pads, the [***Audeze LCD-4***](https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-LCD-4-Headphone-Ebony-Leather/dp/B01DTQ6AMS/ref=sr_1_7?&tag=reviewhuntr-20) sport a sleek yet industrial design that makes the headphones a delight to behold.
