Audiophiles know that nothing may surpass good music. I know this for a fact. Not only do I regularly interact with self-identified audiophiles, I can easily claim to be one myself. I love immersing myself in music. I’d never be able to work out of an office that banned headphones.
 
I may digress, but good music is to an audiophile what a good book is to a bookworm. If you find an artistic work that you like you can go back to it, again and again, to find new meaning in it.
 
By repeat listening sessions of their favorite music, audiophiles can identify notes and ranges that they weren’t able to discover before. Doing so brings about a feeling of accomplishment, exhilaration, and recreation. As such, it serves as a great way to unwind for music lovers.
 
But to feel this profoundly enjoyable experience, you need listening equipment that is capable of bringing the best out of your music and highlight everything on the recording.
 
That is the reason why high-end headphones remain extremely popular among the “music 1%” (those who truly believe in listening to music as a hobby). With specialized design, materials, and functions, these headphones could elevate your music experience, unlike other audio equipment.
 
When you think of these high-end headphones, the Audeze LCD line instantly comes to mind. With the best design, material, and function features, these headphones remain a class apart. One of the most popular models from the series, the [***Audeze LCD-3 Over Ear Headphones with Fazor Elements***](https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&tag=reviewhuntr-20), remains a prime example of excellence in audio equipment.
 
Apart from the company’s popular Fazor Elements, that claim to deliver soundwaves flawlessly, the [***Audeze LCD-3***](https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&tag=reviewhuntr-20) headphones come with ultra-thin yet large diaphragms. These diaphragms promise the delivery of powerful bass, clear top-end, and targeted midrange. The headphones also boast of double-sided magnetic arrays which claim to make distortion a thing of the past. The planar magnetic technology, on the other hand, aims to deliver a natural and accurate sound that highlights every single note on a recording.
 
As noted by users, all of these features make for a pair of headphones that deliver consistently compelling, clear, and flawless sound during each listening experience. Anyone who has used the [***Audeze LCD-3***](https://www.amazon.com/AUDEZE-LCD-3-Headphone-Maple-Leather/dp/B07D9WWKTS/ref=sr_1_14?=1565963906&tag=reviewhuntr-20) cannot stop highlighting the astoundingly high quality of its sound — a factor that remains prevalent in all kinds of recordings and music.

Each earpiece on the headphones comprises of multiple layers of high-quality material, which aims to provide a superior listening experience.
 
For starters, the housing itself is made out of carefully picked and polished maple wood and durable steel.
