Steve Jobs was right. The computer can serve as a bicycle for the mind. That accelerated function of mind is probably why we live in this era of computing. Yes, it’s indeed clear that it may not be the best era for tech. But it certainly is a pleasant one.

  

Computers are available to most people, and consumers can benefit from Moore's law and other concepts that have led to modern personal computing as we know it. That’s why, we all have our favorite personal computers and operating systems.

  

It is no contest that many people prefer Mac over Windows when it comes to personal computing. But for those who tend to go the Windows route for performance and customization, we have got something to talk about today.

  

It’s the {{ link }}.

  

And boy, does it promise great value for money.

  

Not only is it currently at a discounted price but it's perfect for those who are on the go at work or at school - especially when they are on a budget. Without further ado, let's find out how the {{ sn-link }}” holds up against a detailed inspection.

  

First, the Specs

The {{ sn-link }} is said to be fun and functional. It serves as a 2 in 1 laptop and comes with a grey touch HD cover. It comes with a 14 inch HD screen (1366 X 768). It also boasts of an LED-backlit touch display and an 8th Generation Intel Core i3-8145u processor to boot.

  

The computing unit packs quite a punch with its processor that has 4MB Cache and 3.9 GHz of speed. With the Intel UHD Graphics 620 and shared graphics memory, it provides ample multimedia capabilities in its small size.

  

The {{ sn-link }} also has a 128 GB M.2 PCIe Solid State Drive (SSD). Much like most modern laptops, the {{ sn-link }} does away with an optical DVD/CD drive. But it does have a 3-in-1 media card reader, USB 3.0, and USB 2.0 to help users transfer their media files easily. Finally, it also comes with a 3-Cell 42Whr integrated battery.

But the fun is just getting started with this laptop.

  

It Promises an Enjoyable Multimedia Experience

What's amazing about this laptop is that it brings about a cinematic experience for its users. With less buffering, banging sound quality and crystal clear pictures, it will be hard to regret this purchase. Dell tries to go above and beyond with cinematic color, sound, and stream in most of its machines, and it shows in this particular laptop.

  

Users have noted that the laptop meets their performance and storage needs easily. Since the laptop packs an 8th Generation Intel Core i3-8145U processor in addition to its 4GB DDR4 memory, it has plenty of power to carry out multimedia tasks on the go. This means that you can download a substantial amount of software, play games, and enjoy streaming services such as Netflix and the new Disney+ to your heart's delight. But what else this Dell Inspiron 12 2 in 1 Laptop have to offer?

  

Well, its flexibility, of course.

  

The Laptop Offers Flexible Options

The laptop comes with 4 modes and can be termed as the tech equivalent of being all business in the front but throwing a party in the back. If this brings about a fun image to your mind, then the {{ sn-link }} might be the perfect match for you.

  

With its Windows OS, professionals can utilize it as a basic laptop to get their work done, meeting their number crunching and their presentation needs with ease. But that’s not all that the laptop does.

  

There's also its tablet mode that allows it to be used as a way to thumb through users’ favorite e-books or possibly draw the next digital masterpiece. Users can also check the laptop’s tent and media features to truly dive into the processing power of this machine. The laptop also connects to a TV to project is image onto the big screen.

  

Let's see what its users say.

  

It’s Easy to Set Up

Users seem to be quite satisfied with the setup aspect of the {{ sn-link }}. According to them, the process was easy enough in itself. But wherever they seemed to have any difficulties, they were helped through the setup process by the ever-helpful Cortana.

  

Many users mention that browsing and bringing in more applications from the Microsoft store is simple. But going through third party applications through that platform is not as easy as one would want it to be. With that being said, downloading applications directly from the web seems to work as easily as on any other Windows machine.

  

It Strikes a Good Balance Between Features

According to users, the {{ sn-link }} has all the latest features of Windows in terms of energy-conserving and touchscreen. The laptop can also handle the simple workload that users have without getting blazingly hot.

It also works perfectly for simple office tasks. Users mostly agree that it is made for those who want to have a simple device that will perform non-heavy functions. This isn't going to be a device that will be used for heavy gaming or cryptocurrency mining.

  

It Has a Few Issues With Connectivity

Very few users have noted that the computer has some issues when connecting to the internet and when browsing around at first. But they also state that those problems usually get resolved after some time. A few users also lament the fact that the {{ sn-link }} does not come with a bundled DVD player/burner for their different activities. They also note that it doesn't have an RJ45 port to facilitate direct Ethernet connections to a router.

  

Some users were also expecting to receive premium applications such as Microsoft Office with their purchase. But they were disgruntled to find that they had to pay additionally for them. Since buying MS Office remains a standard understanding among Windows users, this particular issue does not have that much impact on the overall value offering.
