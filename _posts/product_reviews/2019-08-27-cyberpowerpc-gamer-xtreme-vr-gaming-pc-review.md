The allure of PC gaming is stronger than ever in these subscription service ridden days. With free multiplayer, cheaper games, and better graphics there's no surprise thousands of people are looking to make the switch to PC. However, building your own PC is not for everyone, as it requires some degree of research and preparation. Not everyone can spare their valuable time for researching and selecting components to eventually build a PC. This is why pre-built systems like the [***CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC***](https://www.amazon.com/CyberpowerPC-Xtreme-i5-9400F-GeForce-GXiVR8060A7/dp/B07PKXQBHN/ref=sr_1_3&tag=reviewhuntr-20) exist, they offer anyone a chance to get into PC gaming without the other hassles of building and testing your own computer.

The [***CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC***](https://www.amazon.com/CyberpowerPC-Xtreme-i5-9400F-GeForce-GXiVR8060A7/dp/B07PKXQBHN/ref=sr_1_3&tag=reviewhuntr-20) features 3 RGB fans mounted at the front. These are large 120mm fans capable of pushing serious air into your computer, keeping it cool under any amount of stress. The rear of the computer features a single RGB 120mm fan. You might assume that having only 1 fan at the back is for cost efficiency, but that is not the case. By having an imbalance of air pressure at the back, CyberPower manages to create negative air pressure, which greatly increases the cooling ability and speed of the air entering the system. All fans are customizable in colour, with a remote provided to go through the various lighting modes.  

Appearance is important, and when you are priced just above 800$, you better show it. The [***CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC***](https://www.amazon.com/CyberpowerPC-Xtreme-i5-9400F-GeForce-GXiVR8060A7/dp/B07PKXQBHN/ref=sr_1_3&tag=reviewhuntr-20) is no stranger to aesthetics, with its RGB fans managing to blend seamlessly into the inky black of the case. Red trim around the case adds a layer of ‘class’ if you will. It features 1 stick of 8GB DDR4 ram, painted with a beautiful crimson to blend in with the build. The motherboard is a deep black, with everything connected to it following a similar colour pattern. Most computers are blessed with beautiful interiors, yet they are never shown. These beautiful interiors are locked inside a metal prison, with no eyes able to truly enjoy them. This case has a tempered glass side panel, allowing everyone to see the beautiful interior of your computer. This computer is beautifully designed and put together, something all users can agree on.

Connection is important, and the [***CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC***](https://www.amazon.com/CyberpowerPC-Xtreme-i5-9400F-GeForce-GXiVR8060A7/dp/B07PKXQBHN/ref=sr_1_3&tag=reviewhuntr-20) delivers. At the front, it features 2 super-fast USB 3.0 ports, mic and audio ports, and a power/reset button. This is an impressive array, yet it pales in comparison to what the computer holds in its rear. It has 6 USB 3.0 ports, 2 USB 2.0 ports, 7.1 audio ports, and an extremely fast ethernet port. You may be wondering what to fill up those USB ports with, well CyberPower has you covered! When you purchase the [***CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC***](https://www.amazon.com/CyberpowerPC-Xtreme-i5-9400F-GeForce-GXiVR8060A7/dp/B07PKXQBHN/ref=sr_1_3&tag=reviewhuntr-20) you receive a free keyboard and mouse. The mouse has 4 programmable buttons and features variable lighting. The keyboard is also well made, with red accents on often used keys. In general, the ports peripherals on this PC were very well received by users.

Everything I've discussed pales in comparison to what really matters, performance! This is the true test of whether the computer has enough power to meet the demand of its users. It features a 6 core I5-9400 CPU capable of handling just about anything you throw at it. The CPU has a base clock of a respectable 2.9 GHz, but the turbo is where it shows its true potential. This CPU manages to get up to 4.1 GHz, able to crush tasks like video rendering and gaming with ease. The graphics card is no weakling either, its a full-sized GTX 1660 with 6GB of video memory. This graphics card crushes all games at 1080p, however, you might have trouble running max settings above that resolution. The graphics card is by far the weakest point of this build, holding the CPU back in demanding tasks. However, most users will never face this as it becomes apparent in only the most demanding tasks. The [***CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC***](https://www.amazon.com/CyberpowerPC-Xtreme-i5-9400F-GeForce-GXiVR8060A7/dp/B07PKXQBHN/ref=sr_1_3&tag=reviewhuntr-20) features a 120GB Solid State Drive that is many times faster than a traditional HDD, yet it also has a 1 Terabyte hard-drive for all your major files. This interesting storage setup allows for windows to run on a blazing fast low storage SSD, while all the large files stay on the huge hard-drive. The performance is easily the most well-received part of this computer, with almost every user prasing it. 

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the [***CyberpowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC***](https://www.amazon.com/CyberpowerPC-Xtreme-i5-9400F-GeForce-GXiVR8060A7/dp/B07PKXQBHN/ref=sr_1_3&tag=reviewhuntr-20) is a superb computer capable of handling almost anything its users throw at it. Everything including and under 1080p gaming is lightwork for this computer. The design of this computer and the free peripherals make it an eyecatcher in any room. CyberPower also gives a 1-year warranty on this computer, so you'll always have peace of mind. Overall, this computer is definitely deserving of its 4.7-star rating on Amazon.
