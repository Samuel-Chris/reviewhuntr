Everyone knows that exercising is excellent for you. The common refrain, “Use it or lose it,” certainly applies to the human form. We live in a sedentary lifestyle inducing world. From our offices where we sit in a chair and work, to our homes where we sit on our couches and play video games or browse through Netflix shows, we usually sit still. This life leads to an increase in health issues and cascades into overall lower quality of life. No one wants that.

  

Thankfully, most people can do simple exercises like walking or running, which can massively increase their quality of life. Running helps to tone the body and refine the mind. It is something that can minimize daily stress, help with cardiovascular health, and relieve depression. A few experts in the matter even think that running is something that propels humans forward because of its role in our evolution.

  

Running was not in fashion for a while, but it has come back. This is evidenced by the success of the Shoe Dog, people like Phil Knight and his company, Nike. Runners now have a large community, more tools, and an increasing number of tracks to do what they love.

  

So if you are planning on joining the running population, a {{ sn-link }} watch might be right for you.

  

Let’s find out what this provides to its wearer.

  

The {{ sn-link }} can easily hold up to 500 songs. That’s something that many runners would want to have and can appreciate as they go for their run. Individuals can add a pair of Bluetooth headphones to their purchases to minimize the need for their mobile devices.

  

One fantastic feature might be the fact that you don’t have to be online to listen to music. The {{ sn-link }} syncs your favorite songs from different streaming providers to allow you to listen offline. Users should note that this might require another premium purchase from the third party music streaming company. Yes, you can connect it to Spotify and download the Spotify app without the need for a smartphone.

  

The next feature is for those who like to keep it simple and modern while they shop. The Garmin Pay contactless payment feature lets users pay easily with the Garmin watch. The contactless pay feature works with select companies allowing runners to travel light.

  

Another compelling component of the {{ sn-link }} is the set of running features it provides to its user base. The watch is known for its “advanced running dynamics” that encompasses information such as stride length, and additional information. Through these features, you could get more information on your heart rate and use that to up your running and training game.

The {{ link }} watch lasts for quite a while and can work for up to 7 days when using smartwatch mode, and at least 5 hours with GPS mode.

  

What else can you expect from the {{ sn-link }} while you start or continue your quest to build strength, and add psychological value to your life? A sleek design. Users find that the watch can even be passed off as a dressy and more formal watch because of its metal accents.

  

The {{ link }} is simple, durable, and made for runners. The watch comes with a simple five-button touch interface that helps you record and keep track of your running workout, and can meet your running needs. Seeing that the watch has a water rating of 5 ATM, runners can also move around in rainy weather so they can always be on the go and take efforts to stay fit and healthy whenever the sky turns the precipitation route

  

The watch is optimized for viewing in any type of weather and time of day. If you like to switch things up, replacing bands is simple and time-effective. The company promises that this is one item that doesn’t disappoint in design or durability.

  

The {{ sn-link }} comes with GPS/GLONASS, Wi-Fi connectivity, smart notifications, training load, wrist heart rate, Garmin Pay, and music storage. In other words, it has everything you might need while you try to stay active. It weighs only 1.4 ounces and is a delight to wear according to users. It comes with preloaded activities including but not limited to running, treadmill running, biking indoors, and cardio. You will need to keep in mind that 1 CR2 battery is needed with this watch for it to perform its functions.

  

More than 55% of users agree that it is a value buy and that it is well worth the purchase. The people who use this watch range from the tenured runner who follows their set trail every day, to the amateur who just started their running and cardiovascular journey. Those that run for 20-25 miles per week find that the watch proves to meet their stringent needs. Since they don’t want to have to run around with their phones, they would rather have a light device and let it help them in their run - the {{ sn-link }} is a perfect fit for those needs.

  

Users find that setup is easy and they can quickly input music before heading outdoors. But it might not be as easy for all users if they have never conducted the process of opening up a Garmin account, have not used Garmin Connect, or other components of Garmin.

  

Take note that the {{ sn-link }} has only been tested with a few types of earphones. As such, make sure to look at complimentary headphones (like the Trekz Titanium) to this Garmin watch.
