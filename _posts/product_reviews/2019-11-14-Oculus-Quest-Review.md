 Often, when you think of virtual reality, you will think of a headset connected to a console, or perhaps a personal computer of some sort. Since its inception, modern virtual reality has always been tied down both metaphorically and literally, by another console or computer running the games you play. With the {{ link }}, all of that changes. Now you can play and experience the virtual reality you love with nothing but the headset and your controllers. The {{ link }} pulls off an all-in-one virtual reality gaming experience perfectly and is a great buy for anyone who enjoys VR. All you have to do is set up the headset with the {{ sn-link }}mobile app on your phone, and you’re ready to play amazing virtual reality games anywhere you want.
 With the {{ link }}, you also get two {{ sn-link }}Touch controllers, a design you might be familiar with if you have used other {{ sn-link }}VR products such as the {{ sn-link }}Rift. these controllers are simple, stylish, and incredibly easy to pick up and use. They fit into your hand nicely and bring your hand gestures and movements into the game perfectly. Because {{ sn-link }}Touch controllers work as two separate halves of a standard game controller, allowing you to hold one in each hand, the {{ link }} can easily scan all hand movements between both hands. All of these features in the controllers alone allow for a truly immersive experience with the {{ link }}.
 The {{ link }} is also very easy to set up. No outside box or console is required, and no personal computer is needed either. For the initial launch, you will need to use the {{ sn-link }}app on your mobile device, but afterwards, you can simply sit back and use nothing but the headset. Once all that is done, you don’t even need to continue to use your phone as all apps and games can be downloaded and played straight off the headset. The plastic cover allows for an incredibly light model, which is nice considering you will be carrying the {{ link }} on your head the entire time you play. As for what is attached to the headset itself, there is nothing more than one strap so it stays on. No wires, no cables, nothing. While speakers are included there is also a headphone jack if you prefer the sound to come from your headphones. 
Most other virtual reality systems almost require large, open spaces if you want the full experience uninterrupted by bumping into a wall or some other real-world obstacle. The Quest, on the other hand, includes {{ sn-link }}Insight tracking. {{ sn-link }}Insight refers to built-in sensors that can detect where you are in a given room at any point in time. This is perfect if you don’t have access to a large room or vast open space at all times, or are limited to tighter, more cramped spaces. The {{ link }}, using {{ sn-link }}Insight, can detect when you are close to a wall, warning you and allowing you to back away. This is perfect for those who cant easily get to a larger room, or for people who just want more immersion overall. 
You also will have immediate access to some of the most critically acclaimed virtual reality titles out there right now, including Vader Immortal, Beat Saber, Superhot VR, and many, many more. If you want to play any of these games for a longer time as well, rest assured that the {{ link }} is incredibly comfortable. The build quality is good and it is nice and lightweight overall. The controllers fit right into your hand and are built in a way that will rarely cause cramping or soreness. The headset itself is comfortable and fits your head nicely. Overall, it’s easy to get lost in the experience while playing games on the {{ link }}, another factor that assists with overall immersion.
The image quality on the {{ link }} is great as well, with a 2880 x 1600 OLED panel, and all of the titles available look stunning on the screen. It’s incredibly fast to set up games and start playing them, and all of them run smoothly and consistently. The {{ sn-link }}can also tell when you are wearing it and turns on automatically when you put it on, and it instantly recognizes up to 5 rooms you have played in and will switch the border map being used to fit whatever room you are in. All things considered, the {{ link }} is the perfect, most accessible virtual reality system on the market now, and is perfect for those who wish to maximize their emersion in the game as they play.
