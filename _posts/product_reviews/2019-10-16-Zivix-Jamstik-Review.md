Those who enjoy music want to experience it in all its glory. Whether they are listening to their favorite artists through headphones, blasting their favorite tunes on speakers, or jamming their hearts out with friends or family, these different aspects let them get the most out of their music.

 

While listening to music is quite common and a very affordable hobby, it gets difficult to hold jamming sessions if you don’t have the right equipment with you. But seeing that guitars are expensive and not accessible to everyone, those who want to indulge into jamming often have to leave that plan behind due to lack of resources.

 

Not anymore.

 

As a portable, electric guitar, the {{ link }} claims to make jamming more accessible and playing a guitar more affordable. Sporting a sleek design, the instrument connects to your smartphone, tablet or computer through Bluetooth 4.0. From there, it is all a matter of pairing it up with any compatible MIDI app, and you can emulate the experience of playing a real guitar in the comfort of your home. All of this comes at a very affordable price, which promises to provide great value for money while also paying attention to the quality of music you are about to enjoy.

 

The {{ link }} boasts of real strings and frets that provide the feeling of playing a real guitar. With a Smart Fretboard, it also promises to provide the user with instant feedback to enhance their playing experience. It comes with multiple modes that make playing the guitar more fun for users, whether they are going solo on a practice session or jamming it out with a friend or family member.

 

The {{ link }} is MIDI compatible, which makes it easier to create and mix music with tunes that are produced directly from the guitar device. For those who have not played a guitar before, the device also comes complete with tutorials and games to add to their learning experience. The magnetic pickup technology in the device picks up even the lightest touch and effectively promises to emulate an experience that is as close to playing a real guitar as possible.

 

The device is available in two packages, with the Black package only having the guitar in it. Whereas, at a slightly higher price, the Case Bundle has a handy travel case or gig bag that lets users carry their guitar around while keeping it safe from dust and grime.

 

Speaking of carrying the guitar around, the {{ link }} promises to be travel-friendly. Weighing only 1.9lbs with dimensions of 16.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 inches, the device puts portability front and center. But that doesn’t mean that it compromises on design or style by any means. The guitar boasts of a sleek design that is comprised of clean lines, a black frame and silver strings. At the same time, multiple buttons on the side provide additional control to the user. At first look, it is instantly reminiscent of a modernized version of a traditional electric guitar, which is exactly the look that it is going for.

 

When it comes actually to use the guitar, users have found it to be delivering on its promises for the most part. It has been noted that the guitar’s overall functions work as advertised, with its fretboard and strings being quite helpful in composing new tunes while also playing old ones.

 

Users have noted that the {{ link }} is fairly easy to use, with the connectivity and setting adjustments being an improvement on its predecessor, the original {{ sn-link }}. With that, the device also comes with the ability to add multiple {{ sn-link }} to a single device, which paves the way for true to life jamming sessions with friends or family.

 

It has been noted that the native app for {{ sn-link }} is also fairly simple and has an intuitive design, which makes it easy to make adjustments to the device’s sound delivery and play quality. This is especially praised by users who have not used a device like the {{ sn-link }} before, or who have simply never had a chance to test the real-world functionality of an actual guitar.

 

The acoustics delivered by {{ link }} also earn high praise from those who have used the device. This is possible due to the true to life sound quality that is emulated through the carefully developed strings, fret, and form-factor. Overall, users believe that the {{ sn-link }} is exactly the jamming device they needed to belt out jamming sessions with their loved ones.

 

It has been noted that the native app for {{ sn-link }} is also fairly simple and has an intuitive design, which makes it easy to make adjustments to the device’s sound delivery and play quality.
