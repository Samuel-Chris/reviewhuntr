If your work or hobby involves aviation by any chance, then you must know the importance of communication in the medium. In a medium where a single second’s delay or a slightly muffled sound could be life-threatening, your communication equipment must remain top of the line.

Not having proper communication tools or experiencing poor audio while flying an aircraft can make you extremely anxious when the only feeling you should associate with the action is that of the utmost comfort, mixed with some adventure.

  
On the other hand, clear communication gives you the peace of mind that you require to fly correctly. It also enhances your experience in a way that leaves you feeling comfortable, and allows you to enjoy your flight the way that you are supposed to.

 
That is why you absolutely must choose a communication tool that you could rely upon no matter what. Doing so doesn’t only keep you safe, but it also takes care of the wellbeing of others.

When it comes to communication equipment that you can depend upon, the {{ link }} is a class apart. When compared to traditional aviation headsets, it claims to provide higher active noise reduction, while also ensuring less clamping force. But it doesn’t stop there, and also offers active equalization along with customizable audio prioritization, as well as up to 45 hours of use from two AA batteries.

When put together, these features provide the {{ sn-link }} with more than enough power to be identified as a strong communication tool, which could be very useful for those who are looking for a multipurpose headset to improve their flying experience. The fact that the headset is certified to FAA TSO-C139 and EASA ETSO-C139 standards further speak for its capabilities as an aviation communication tool.

  
The {{ sn-link }} headset also sports a comfortable design that is meant to make communications seamless during your flying experience. With an electret microphone that is built for clarity in relaying messages, the headset promises to be as reliable in transmitting outward communication as it is in delivering it. The microphone also comes with the ability to be plugged into either of the earcups, which adds yet another level of comfort for the user as they fly their plane or use the headset as a traditional communication device.


While it carries the traditional analog option, the {{ sn-link }} also has a strong feature in terms of Bluetooth wireless connectivity working for it. Since more and more communication and navigation devices now offer wireless connectivity, the Bluetooth feature improves the headset’s analog-only structure. With that being said, it is still available in an analog-only option, at a slightly lower price.

According to Bose, its A20 headset provides 30 percent more active noise reduction and 30 percent less clamping force as compared to conventional aviation headsets. This quality makes the {{ sn-link}} quite a favorable choice, since the more noise is reduced during aviation communication, the better it is for the pilot as well as the ones who are corresponding with them through the control tower.

As noted by users, these features shine through in terms of their active communication, where the noise reduction and clarity in transmission are significantly noticeable. This holds true whether they are flying a small Cessna or a high noise helicopter. Users have also claimed that they can communicate very clearly even if their main volume is turned to a lower setting. This also makes the headset appeal to student pilots, who need to be extra-reliant on their communication during their training.

  

The {{ sn-link }} also delivers on the aspect of sound quality and makes it so much easier to listen to music through a communication headset. While the Bose Active EQ feature adjusts the levels of audio notes in a communication or recording channel, the ergonomic control module lets you seamlessly switch between your communication and music. At the same time, it also lets you mix two audio channels at once. Multipoint connectivity enhances this feature and makes it easier to handle different communication channels. According to users, this feature adds to the ease of use that the headset promises to them.

 
Since the {{ sn-link }} is designed for extended use and utilizes high-quality materials, the headset is very comfortable to wear. Users have noted that the headset remains very lightweight, which is due to the high-quality plastic that it uses for its structure.



The battery life also provides great backup time whether you are communicating actively or just listening to music. This has been noted by various users, who term the headset as being worth every penny. They note how easy it is to communicate during each of their flights, while also ensuring that they don’t have to run around finding charging ports for their headset before every takeoff.

With these qualities, users have gone on record to deem the {{ sn-link }} as one of the best headsets for aviation that are currently available in the market. Nearly everyone who uses it is very happy with it, and their recommendations to others for buying their own pair of {{ sn-link }} add to the overall credibility of the headset.

With that being said, some users take issue with the material, since it is mostly plastic. But the lightweight and soft-touch add to the users’ comfort level, who argue against such complaints very quickly.

## Conclusion

It is safe to say that the {{ link }} is a bold yet successful attempt by the company to strengthen its presence within the aviation industry further.

With features that appeal to different levels of experience for various pilots, it remains an investment that could help you from learning to fly a plane to operating your small aircraft on your own with ease.

Pursue adventure and life with these headphones to accompany you and keep you in the know while you fly.
