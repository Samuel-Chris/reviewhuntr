Do you like surfing the internet? - Of course, you do. So now you might be thinking, why ask such a redundant question? Well, do you like surfing the internet with slow or fast speeds? -  Okay, that answer should still be obvious, but to be truthful, it's selective. Anybody can buy a new router and do a quick google search, then claim that said router is Sonic The Hedgehog when it comes to internet speed. But often enough, this is a ruse to give you a lower quality router, or sometimes even a used one. (Looking at you, Spectrum.)

Even older routers can process a simple search engine result with minimal difficulty. I mean, it barely takes any processing power to do it. So, with that in mind, where do you find the downfall in the common WIFI routers you'll receive as part of your internet plan? Usually, anything that requires 5+ Mbps, which almost always includes downloading large files or playing even a basic 3D game. We can all remember the days when it took five minutes to boot up your Windows XP, and that persists today in the form of low-quality WIFI routers.

Okay, so after getting that little tidbit out of the way, what's the solution? Yet another easy answer. Buy a third-party router with the specs you believe will satisfy your daily usage. However, even then, you still need to make sure you get what you're buying; which is where this review comes in. So, without further ado, here is my review for the [***NETGEAR Nighthawk WIFI Router***](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C65K9H9/ref=s9_acsd_bw_wf_a_ACPCWF17_cdl_11?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&tag=reviewhuntr-20).

In terms of design, it's not bad at all. It's a Smart WIFI router and is capable of running speeds up to 1900 Mbps; which, might make lightning look slow if you think about it. other than that, it has an expansive 1800 square feet of coverage and can support up to 30 devices on the network. With that in mind, it seems like a true speed racer for even the most bandwidth greedy geek out there. But let's take a look at the ratings first and see whether or not it holds up to its advertised value.

Released on April 25, 2018, this router sells for an interesting price of $109.99 and includes free shipping. It currently ships relatively fast too, so if you want it now, you'll get it now. In terms of amazon ratings, it has an exceptional 4.2 out 5 stars. Making it seem like its too good to be true, right? Well, to confirm this, let's take a look at the enormous 18,626 reviews that customers have left on this product. - Starting with Ivaneth, we already are seeing a little bit of suspicious activity. As he claims that the router advertised on the page is not the one you will likely receive, so keep this in mind if you're skeptical. He gave this device a three out of five, so he must have liked something though!

Moving on, we learn that they may have some frustrating customer support. David B comments that while he did like several features of the router, he does have some severe gripes. For one, he says that their customer service is picky and a little greedy too. Why? Well, they supposedly want to charge you just to find out what's wrong with your product! Crazy, right? Well, if that's not bad enough, he later states that they were supposed to follow up with him via email; which would never arrive. If this is all true, then you're in for a bad experience if your router ever breaks down. He gave them a 1 star out of 5, and rightfully so.

On a more positive vibe, the user Matt Sayar says that he got the router he desired and that it truly delivers when it comes to speed. He goes on to rate this product 5 out of 5 stars.

### Conclusion

These are only a few of the reviews left by a multitude of customers. Unfortunately, most of the recent ones do not seem to be very positive regarding the product. However, it does have an overwhelming 75% of 5-star reviews. So maybe they started with the right intentions, but have started to shift their focus to bigger and better products. 

If you want something fast and aren't willing to pay TOO much money. This might be the device for you -  but beware of possible troubles that may lay ahead for you. They might not be worth it in the end. So choose wisely!

Thanks for reading!
