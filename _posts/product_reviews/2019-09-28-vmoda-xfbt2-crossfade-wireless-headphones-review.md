When it comes to striking a balance between comfort and high-quality audio, nothing fulfills these requirements for an audiophile the way that Bluetooth-powered headphones do.

It remains understandable as well since Bluetooth headphones are specifically built to provide wireless playback while still maintaining a certain standard of audio quality. While the sound quality in most Bluetooth-only headphones is constrained by their technology, they always offer quite an impressive soundstage.

But all of this is further enhanced if these headphones also come with wired playback - which allows them to compete with superior quality headphones in terms of delivering clear, impressive sound.

With that, finding such a pair of headphones could be difficult. This is especially true when looking for one that fits a specific price point while also being respectful of sustainability and lifestyle choices. Choices may include those such as a product that does not use animal leather in its structure.

That is where this offering by V-MODA comes in.

For audiophiles who respect a particular lifestyle and want to abide by it in every shape and form, the {{ link }} seem to be a perfect fit.

In addition to being sold at an affordable price, the headphones come with a structure that is built with high quality, vegan leather. This makes them one of the few options in high-quality headphones that are made for vegans while also being respectful of budgetary constraints.

But being wireless or using sustainable and vegan materials are not the only qualities exhibited by the {{ sn-link }}. The headphones also comprise of 50mm dual-diaphragm drivers, hi-resolution CCAW coils, and hi-res audio certified by the Japan Audio Society (JAS). They also come with Analog Purist Zero Latency, which claims to prevent any latency issues that are often encountered with gaming, videos, and music performances such as those of DJs. As noted by users, all of these features result in a seamless, precise, and distortion-free listening experience, which remains impressive on all accounts.

Available in black, white, and rose gold colors, the {{ sn-link }} also sports a high-quality structure that uses a Steel Flex headband along with the vegan leather specified above. To enhance the value proposition of this structure, the headphones are also foldable to a very impressive extent through V-MODA’s Cliq Fold feature. This makes them a perfect fit for the unique, Exoskeleton case that comes with them. It has been noted that these structural elements provide optimal durability for these headphones.

The headphones also come with a built-in microphone, which is integrated into the headset as a stealth-like feature. This hidden microphone allows users to make clear and hassle-free phone calls, while also providing them with support for voice command and recognition features.

As you might have guessed already, the {{ sn-link }} come equipped with a hybrid feature, which lets them connect to other devices via Bluetooth or analog cable.

Given that the {{ sn-link }} comes with Bluetooth wireless connectivity, they come with their own battery backup. Here, the headphones demonstrate an impressive 14 hours of battery life, with the FastCharge ability offering up to 4 hours of battery backup against a 30-minute charge. Of course, this battery backup is only reserved for playback over Bluetooth. If users chose to use the headphones with a wire rather than its battery, they could enjoy unlimited hours of playback. Users have noted this feature to be a strong selling point for the {{ sn-link }}.

While Hi-Resolution audio is only available in wired mode and not on Bluetooth, those opting for the Rose Gold version of the headphones could enjoy the Qualcomm aptX feature, which promises to provide CD-like quality even over Bluetooth.

While these features make up for a great pair of multi-function headphones, they don’t let the {{ sn-link }} turn away from sound quality, the one element that is the most important aspect of any headphones. Users have noted that the {{ sn-link }} provides an impressive soundstage with distinct clarity.

It has been noted that the sound produced by the V-MODA XFBT2 Crossfade 2 remains quite clear and translates the notes of any recording to real-life quite well. This alludes to how the 50mm dual-diaphragm work their magic in keeping bass, mids, and highs separate, with the difference being heard in the sound quality delivered by the headphones.

Features such as hi-resolution CCAW coils, JAS certified hi-res audio, and Analog Purist Zero Latency only add to the effectiveness of the sound quality, and provide an ideal soundstage. In fact, users have noted that the sound delivered by the {{sn-link }} is so impressive that it makes the upgrade from their previous headphones feel absolutely worth it.

The durability and comfort also play a big part in making users recommend the {{ sn-link }} to others. Since the headphones use high-quality materials with nearly-indestructible Steel Flex, they prove to stand the test of time. With that, the materials used during the creation of these headphones make them exceptionally comfortable for extended wear.

With that, some users take issue with the way that the highs and mids sound within the headphones. But for the most part, even those critical of the sound quality agree that using the {{ sn-link }} was definitely an impressive experience.

## Conclusion

In fact, it wouldn’t be incorrect to state that the headphones prove to be an all-round fit to the needs of the typical audiophile, but without burdening their pockets with high prices.
