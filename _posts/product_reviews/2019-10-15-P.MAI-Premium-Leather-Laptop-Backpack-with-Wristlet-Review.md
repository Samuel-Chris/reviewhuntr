In the professional world, women executives must work quite hard on a regular basis. Whether they are fighting this battle from their desk or in the field, in the boardroom or over a videocon, they mostly need to work rigorously to present themselves as a confident, assertive and knowledgeable personality. If you are a woman in any sector of business, you might have already gone through the same experience, or at least witnessed it with some of your coworkers.


Besides sporting business acumen, women also need to make sure that they are dressed in a way that doesn’t let someone undermine their hard-earned value due to the way they look. That is why power suits, sharp shoes, and a no-nonsense expression is always attributed to a necessary team player.

 
But seeing that pulling off such a look is not easy, there’s a lot of work put in by various designers and stylists to ensure that women look their most confident while navigating their way through various sectors of business. One such design house is P.MAI, which specializes in making fashion accessories for women execs. While the label has many offerings, its {{ sn-link }} stands out due to many reasons.

The {{ sn-link }} doesn’t look like your typical messenger bag. Instead, it is designed as a sleek backpack that has space for a 15-inch laptop, four insert pockets, a water bottle holder, and a zipper pocket at the front. These features ensure that the laptop bag projects a powerful yet non-jarring look.

The {{ sn-link }} is made from premium Nappa leather as well as high quality 2520D nylon. Due to the usage of these materials, it boasts of being both luxurious and durable. In addition to aesthetics and strength, the bag also claims to be comfortable for its users. With padded backstraps, a luggage strap, and adjustable webbing, the bag is built to be worn or carried easily without taking its toll on its owner.

Sporting three different color options with two-tone colors and golden zippers, the {{ sn-link }} looks sleek and stylish to project a look of finesse with its dimensions of 12.5 x 6 x 15.5 inches. Made specifically for women, the {{ sn-link }} has the aesthetic to match high fashion in many aspects.

To add to its value, the {{ sn-link }} comes with a separate dust bag as well as a wristlet. While the dust bag is to be used whenever someone is storing their bag away for the night, the matching wristlet provides more convenience in handling any cards or equipment they need on hand while carrying the bag around.


When it comes to practical usage, the first thing that users note about the {{ sn-link }} is its stylish design. Users have mentioned that the {{ sn-link }} looks quite impressive in the way that it has been crafted, and the premium materials used in it bring out the most appealing elements in its design. Since the bag uses a mix of Nappa calf leather and premium quality 2520D nylon, the contrast of material and the chosen colors for each element give the bag a multi-dimensional look.

With that, users have also noted that the {{ sn-link }} provides them with a roomy yet organized space inside the bag, which could fit a variety of their needs besides carrying a laptop.

Users have noted that they have been able to carry legal papers inside the {{ sn-link }}, while the pocket sleeves have helped them arrange their additional documents with ease. Since the bottle holder pocket is inside the {{ sn-link }} and provides a steady hold on most commonly sized bottles, it prevents the possibility of spills while also keeping users’ bottles safe from any dust or external contaminants during their travel.

Users have also noted that the bag’s ability to hold various things at once doesn’t require them to bargain the storage of one thing for another. Such users mention that even with a laptop, they can fit their required paperwork and power cords into the bag easily.

But even with all these features in terms of looks and functionality, users have noted that the {{ sn-link }} remains quite sturdy and durable. This, once again, is due to the materials that are used within the {{ sn-link }}, which allow it to hold its own against regular wear and tear. With that, the size of the {{ sn-link }} serves as a critical component. It ensures that its strength doesn’t play against it. Also, it doesn’t make it look too big for women executives, who need to maintain a particular aesthetic with their accessories.


Users have noted that these qualities come together to present a laptop bag that doesn’t look like one remarkably. But which still has all the functionalities that one could expect from a traditional laptop or messenger bag.

Only a couple of users take issue with the quality of the material. This is by far the only complaint that is voiced by a minimal number of users. A vast majority of other users cannot simply stop singing praises of the {{ sn-link }}.



## Conclusion

Overall, users note that the{{ link }} is something that provides excellent value for money. Some have gone as far as to state that it is everything that they need in a laptop or executive bag, with utilities and functionality packed in a nicely wrapped exterior.

If you are a woman in business who needs the most out of her accessories, then the {{ sn-link }} might prove to be an excellent fit for you.
