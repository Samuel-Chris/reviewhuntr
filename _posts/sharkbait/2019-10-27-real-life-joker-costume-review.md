We live in a society that loves Halloween. We all could agree that Halloween is easily one of the coolest parts of the year. You are getting free candy from your neighbors for no reason at all, freaking out because you don't find the perfect idea for your costume this year, parents letting their children play with their friends, at night, with lots of disguised people all around. Michael Jackson's private heaven. But this year, you don't have to worry about which one could be the ideal costume for you. Costume & Customs is ready to help you be the laugh of your office's Halloween Party this October.

One of the world's most highly regarded costume designer and manufacturer brings you the brand new Real Life Joker Costume Equipment. Taking advantage of the popularity of this year's Joker movie starring Joaquin Phoenix, the people from Costumes & Customs has developed a hyperrealistic Joker costume.  That allows you to experience what Phoenix felt when he was performing as the Joker. Without overwhelming success, worldwide recognition, and undisputed wealth. This Halloween you can't miss the chance to set aside the daily clown costume you call "my job's uniform", and replace it with this masterly girl-magnet-different-kind-of-clown costume.

The Real-Life Joker Costume comes equipt with everything you need to be in Joker's skin for a night. This kit includes the whole Joker's original outfit, a full set of professional makeup with a green-haired wig, and an ensemble of different authentic guns and knives to get the full experience. It also has a CD with a hardcore rock music playlist to listen to while you apply the makeup on your face. Because we know that protecting your masculinity is vital to you. And you can hide the weapons throughout different spots distributed all over the suit.

This costume is ideal for all those who want to express how hilarious, yet mysterious they really are. Also, giving you the chance to surprise everyone at the party with some unexpected dance moves, your quirky abrupt and contagious laughter, or killing everyone there when the alcohol runs out. If you're really a Joker fan, we know you'll manage to do all three at once! The additional ammo and the character's charisma sold separately.

Halloween is that time of the year to be enjoyed as you please. Kids run and hide all around the neighborhood doing tricks and mischiefs, teenagers have lovely parties where everyone has the same costumes, and everyone gets expired candy. Thanks to the Real Life Joker Costume Kit, the lonely straight men will have the opportunity to drain all of their insecurities and frustrations by committing crimes disguised as the Joker.

The positive reception has been so overwhelming that Costumes & Customs is now selling an extra DVD that teaches you to be as real as the costume itself! It has dance lessons with the latest cool moves, a video guide on how to properly use your weapons with torture techniques, and a two hour documentary with descriptions of different traumas and illnesses you can choose from in case you have none.

The demand for this hyper-realistic costume has been staggering. In some cities, there have reported incidents where large groups of men dressed as the Joker start to shoot and stab people in different locations such as movie theaters, shopping malls, and good stand-up comedy shows. Unfortunately, there is no record of people dressed as Batman saving anyone's life.

The increasing crime wave that followed the release of this product is an excellent reflection of the brilliant accuracy of this costume. These Jokers can run freely, having fun, causing mass homicides. Those who bought their outfits from other companies have to conform with the dull Superman attire that can't even make them fly. Or their Lego character costumes that still won't make them fit in anywhere.

Allowing people to become their favorite character instead of just dressing up like them is what makes the work of Costumes & Customs so unique. But this is not the first time the company produced a costume that has turned out so realistic. For example, in the Costumes & Customs catalog, there are other hyperreal disguises. Like a Kylie Jenner costume containing expensive women clothes, an iPod full of "Rise and Shine" remixes with Travis Scott's entire discography, and a baby girl dol. The costume kit doesn't come with a father doll.

The sales of the Real Life Joker Costume are growing with every second. People are starting to get used to the appearances of people dressing up as the Joker, which are not always dangerous but sometimes are somewhat awkward. We asked Randall McCarthy, one of the latest buyers, why he likes this costume so much: "Are you nuts? This costume has given me all I've ever needed. If I wear my Joker clothes, people start to notice me. Girls are now laughing at my jokes! And if they don't, I kill them. Having this disguise compensates having grown without parents, attention, or affection!"

Verdict: The Real-Life Joker Costume is out in your favorite stores now! Don't give up the chance to show people that ignoring you in high school can have serious consequences. Or use it to go to a party. You don't have to think about it twice, order yours now and finally get a reason to get out of your mother's basement this Halloween!
