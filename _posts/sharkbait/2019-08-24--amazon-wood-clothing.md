After a hard time trying to figure out a way to help save the amazon following weeks of insane deforestation and colossal fires, this new line of clothes entirely made out of Amazonian wood wants to make a big entrance into the ecological design market -and they did it-.

From wooden pants to vine shoes and leaf-made t-shirts, entrepreneur and designer William Treecut explained his proposal to save the amazon rainforest: “I got tired of seeing all those Instagram influencers, only sending their thoughts and prayers after those alarming fires. So I thought 'well, maybe the lungs of the planet need some big-ass bucks to finally catch some breath’. Then I started to create a profitable business out of this, where we allow people to finally give their money to something that will help rebuild the amazon, while also looking amazing for their crying pictures. 95% of our earnings go to the countless ONGs that are seeking funds to recover the rainforest, and 5% to repair the chainsaws that get damaged while extracting the product to make our finest clothing”.

Their system is simple: cut down the trees, make awesome clothes, then donate the funds to plant more trees. At first, the idea seemed a little bit unethical, and many ONGs and Instagram celebrities —like Rudy Bega— Immediately expressed their skepticism about the whole initiative. As Mr. Bega explained, “I don't know if this will help the amazon at all, but if I can get a taste of this product for free, I'll probably promote it as well. Please check my new video”. But as Hare O'Daiorama, president of Greenpeace explained: “it was literally the only decent proposal”. He praised the projections made out by Treecut, specifically stating that “the cost-benefit graphic had a lot of ecologic green color on its design -so it had to be a sustainable idea”.

We approached the company and bought a whole lot of new outfits to test their quality. The wooden pants were the first choice: although their design was a little old-fashioned —which was the main intention, as the design can easily pass as the pants of a Victorian armor—, we found that having little mobility and itchy crotches weren't something we could get used to. A similar thing happened with the leaf t-shirt: the leafs caused an allergic reaction on our team, wreaking havoc all across the newsroom. Surprisingly, the premium line of oak and pine tree t-shirts and pants felt comfy, and its hipster design stood up for the enormous expectations that we had with this clothing line (and its price. We ran out of money to afford a writer for this article).

As we know, hipster-culture is a fusion of several preferences, such as dressing in vintage clothing, hold pacifist and green views, and having a desire of moral superiority on most of the current topics of modern society. And this clothing line seems to have everything in its favor to shake the grounds of society. As Treecut explained, “there's no more vintage thing than using designs inspired in the 1600's era or something more pacifist than the sound of a chainsaw in the middle of the Amazon”. The company is also exploring other options to please the needs of a public that is hungry for justice: a honey bee pure, a new line of white shark teeth's kitchen knives, and a very interesting product: a brand-new line of shoes made out of the skin of endangered species, that will certainly create consciousness about animal hunting.

Our verdict: the oak and pine tree t-shirts and pants were stylish, but not very useful for runners. We'll wait for the honey bee puré and the shark teeth kitchen knives to see if things can get more interesting.
